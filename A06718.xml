            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>WHen thoſe States, that are conquered, as it is ſaid, have been accuſtomed to live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their own Laws, and in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, there are three wayes for a man to hold them. The firſt is to demoliſh all their ſtrong places; the other, perſonally to goe and dwell there; the third, to ſuffer them to live under their own Laws, drawing from them ſome tribute, and creating therein an Oligar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, that may continue it in thy ſervice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that State being crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by that Prince, knowes it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſiſt, without his aid and force, who is like to doe all he can to maintain it; and with more facility is a City kept by meanes of her own Citizens, which hath been us'd before to live free, than
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:12126:22"/> by any other way of keeping. We have for example the <hi>Spartans;</hi> and the <hi>Romans;</hi> the <hi>Spartans</hi> held <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Thebes,</hi> creating there an Oligarchy: yet they loſt it. The <hi>Romans</hi> to be ſure of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pua, Carthage,</hi> and <hi>Numantia,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantell'd them quite, and ſo loſt them not: they would have kept <hi>Greece</hi> as the <hi>Spartans</hi> had held them, leaving them free, &amp; letting them injoy their own Lawes; and it proſpered not with them: ſo that they were forc'd to deface many Cities of that province to hold it. For in truth there is not a ſurer way to keep them under, than by demoliſhments; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever becomes maſter of a City us'd to live free, and diſmantells it not; let him look himſelfe to bee ruin'd by it: for it alwayes in time of rebellion takes the name of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for refuge, and the ancient orders it had; which neither by length of time, nor for any favours afforded them, are ever forgotten; and for any thing that can bee
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:12126:23"/> done, or order'd, unleſſe the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants be diſunited and diſperſ'd, that name is never forgotten, nor thoſe cuſtomes: but preſently in every chance recourſe is thither made: as <hi>Piſa</hi> did after ſo many yeeres, that ſhe had been ſubdu'd by the <hi>Florentines.</hi> But when the Cities or the Provinces are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to live under a Prince, and that whole race is quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpated; on one part being us'd to obey; on the the other, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their old Prince; they agree not to make one from among themſelves: they know not how to live in liberty; in ſuch manner that they are much ſlower to take armes, and with more facility may a Prince gaine them, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure himſelfe of them. But in Republiques there is more life in them, more violent hatred, more earneſt deſire of revenge; nor does the remembrance of the ancient liberty ever leave them, or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to reſt: ſo that the ſafeſt way, is, either to ruine
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:12126:23"/> them, or dwell among them.</p>

               <p>LEt no man marvaile, if in the diſcourſe I ſhall make of new Principalities, both touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Prince, and touching a State, I ſhall alleadge very famous examples: for ſeeing men almoſt alwayes walk in the pathes bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by others, and proceed in their actions by imitation, and being that others wayes cannot bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly follow'd, nor their vertues, whoſe patterne thou ſet-ſt before thee, attain'd unto; a wiſe man ought alwayes to tread the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of the worthieſt perſons, and imitate thoſe that have been the moſt excellent: to the end that if his vertue arrive not thereto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at leaſt it may yeeld ſome ſavour thereof, and doe as good Archers uſe, who thinking the place they
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:12126:24"/> intend to hit, too farre diſtant, &amp; knowing how farr the ſtrength of their bow will carry, they lay their ayme a great deale higher than the mark; not for to hit ſo high with their arrow, but to bee able with the help of ſo high an aime to reach the place they ſhoot at. I ſay, that in Principalities wholly new, where there is a new Prince; there is more and leſſe difficulty in maintaining them, as the vertue of their Conquerour is greater or leſſer. And becauſe this ſucceſſe, to become a Prince of a private man, preſuppoſes either vertue, or fortune; mee thinks the one and the other of theſe two things in part ſhould mitigate many difficulties; however he that hath leſſe ſtood upon fortune, hath maintain'd himſelfe the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Moreover it ſome what faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litates the matter in that the Prince is conſtrain'd, becauſe hee hath not other dominions, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to come and dwell there. But to come to theſe, who by their
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:12126:24"/> own vertues, and not by fortune, attain'd to be Princes; the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenteſt of theſe are, <hi>Moyſes, Cyrus, Romulus, Theſeus,</hi> and ſuch like; and though of <hi>Moyſes</hi> we are not to reaſon, he onely executing the things that were commanded him by God; yet merits hee well to be admir'd, were it only for that grace, that made him worthy to converſe with God. But conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and the others, who either got or founded Kingdomes; wee ſhall find them all admirable; and if their particular actions, and Lawes bee throughly weigh'd, they will not appeare much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from thoſe of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> which hee receiv'd from ſo Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne an inſtructer. And exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their lives and actions, it will not appeare, that they had other help of fortune, than the occaſion, which preſented them with the matter wherein they might introduce what forme they then pleas'd; and without that occaſion, the vertue of their mind
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:12126:25"/> had been extinguiſh'd; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that vertue, the occaſion had been offer'd in vaine. It was then neceſſary for <hi>Moyſes</hi> to find the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſlaves in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and oppreſs'd by the <hi>Aegyptians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> to the end that they to get out of their thraldome, ſhould bee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to follow him. It was fit that <hi>Romulus</hi> ſhould not bee kept in <hi>Albia,</hi> but expos'd preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his birth that hee might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come King of <hi>Rome,</hi> and founder of that City. There was need that <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſhould find the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> diſcontented with the <hi>Medes</hi> government, and the <hi>Medes</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and effeminate through their long peace. <hi>Theſeus</hi> could not make proof of his vertue, had not he found the <hi>Athenians</hi> diſpers'd. Theſe occaſions therefore made theſe men happy, and their excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent vertue made the occaſion be t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nnobled, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding fortunate. They, who by vertuous wayes, like unto theſe,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:12126:25"/> become Princes, attain the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality with difficulty, but hold it with much eaſe; and the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties they find in gayning the Principality, ariſe partly from the new orders and courſes they are forc'd to bring in, to lay the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of their State, and worke their own ſecurity. And it is to be conſider'd, how there is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing harder to take in hand, nor doubtfuller to ſucceed, nor more dangerous to mannage, than to be the chiefe in bringing in new orders; for this Chiefe finds all thoſe his enimies, that thrive upon the old orders, and hath but luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme defenders of all thoſe that would doe well upon the new orders, which luke-warme temper proceeds part ly from feare of the oppoſers, who have the lawes to their advantage; partly from the incredulity of the men, who truly beleeve not a new thing, unleſſe there bee ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain proofe given them thereof. Whereupon it ariſes, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:12126:26"/> they that are adverſaries take the occaſion to aſſayle, they doe it factiouſly; and theſe others defend but cooly, ſo that their whole party altogether runs a hazzard. Therefore it is neceſſary, being we intend throughly to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe this part, to examine, if theſe innovators ſtand of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or if they depend upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; that is, if to bring their worke to effect, it bee neceſſary they ſhould intreat, or be able to conſtrain. In the firſt caſe they alwayes ſucceed ill, and bring no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to paſſe; but when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend of themſelves, and are able to force, than ſeldome it is that they hazzard. Hence came it that all the Prophets that were arm'd, prevail'd; but thoſe that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd, were too weak: for beſides what wee have alleadg'd, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the people is changeable; and eaſie to bee perſwaded to a matter; but it is hard alſo to ſettle them in that perſwaſion. And therefore it behooves a man to be
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:12126:26"/> ſo provided, that when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>eeve no longer, hee may be able to compell them thereto by force. <hi>Moyſes, Cyrus, Theſeus,</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus</hi> would never have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to cauſe their Lawes long to be obey'd, had they been diſarm'd; as in our times it befell Fryer <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome Savanarola,</hi> who periſh'd in his new conſtitutions, when the multitude began not to beleeve him; neither had hee the meanes to keep them firme, that had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leev'd; nor to force beleefe in them that had not beleev'd him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch men as theſe, in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings find great difficulty, and all their dangers are in the way, and theſe they muſt ſurmount by their vertue: but having once ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterd them, and beginning to bee honourd by all, when they have rooted thoſe out that envy'd their dignities, they remain powerfull, ſecure, honourable, and happy. To theſe choice Examples, I will adde one of leſſe remarque; but it ſhall hold ſome proportion with
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:12126:27"/> them, and this ſhall ſuffice me for all others of this kind, which is <hi>Hiero</hi> the <hi>Siracuſan.</hi> He of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man, became Prince of <hi>Sira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſa,</hi> nor knew hee any other ayd of fortune, than the occaſion: for the <hi>Siracuſans</hi> being oppreſs'd, made choyce of him for their Captaine, whereupon hee deſerv'd to be made their Prince: and he was of ſuch vertue even in his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate fortune, that hee who writes of him, ſayes, he wanted nothing of reigning, but a Kingdome. This man extinguiſh'd all the old ſouldiery, ordein'd the new; left the old allyances, entertain'd new; and as he had friendſhip, and ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that were his own, upon that ground he was able to build any edifice; ſo that hee indur'd much trouble in gaining, and ſufferd but little in maintaining.</p>

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:12126:28"/> which others have caſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were Princes. For the one and the other of theſe wayes about the attaining to be a Prince, by Vertue, or by Fortune, I will alleage you two examples which have been in the days of our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. Theſe were <hi>Francis Sfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> and <hi>Caeſar Borgia; Francis</hi> by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uſt meanes and with a great deal of vertue, of a private man got to be Duke of Millan; and that which with much payns he had gaind, he kept with ſmall adoe. On the other ſide <hi>Caeſar Borgia</hi> (commonly termd Duke <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>) gott his ſtate by his Fathers fortune, and with the ſame loſt it; however that for his owne part no paynes was ſpard, nor any thing omitted, which by a diſcreet and valorous man ought to have been done, to faſten his roots in thoſe Eſtates, which others armes or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had beſtowed on him; for (as it was formerly ſayd) he that lays not the foundations firſt, yet might be able by means of his
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:12126:29"/> extraordinary vertues to lay them afterwards, however it be with the great trouble of the architect, and danger of the aedifice. If ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we conſider all the Dukes progreſſes, we may perceive how great foundations he had caſt for his future power, which I judge a matter not ſuperfluous to runne over; becauſe I ſhould not well know, what better rules I might give to a new Prince, than the patterne of his actions; and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the courſes he took, availd him not, yet was it not his fault, but it proceeded from an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary and extreame maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of fortune. Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixt, deſiring to make the Duke his ſonne a great man, had a great many difficulties, preſent and future: Firſt hee ſaw no way there was whereby hee might be able to make him Lord of any State, that was not the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; and if hee turnd to take that from the Church, hee knew that the Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> and the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:12126:29"/> would never agree to it; for <hi>Faenza</hi> and <hi>Riminum</hi> were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Venetians</hi> protection. Moreover, hee ſaw that the armes of <hi>Italy,</hi> and thoſe whereof in particular hee might have been able to make ſome uſe, were in their hands, who ought to feare the Popes greatneſſe: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not any wayes rely upon them: being all in the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s</hi> and <hi>Colonnies</hi> hands, and thoſe of their faction. It was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary then, that thoſe matters thus appointed by them, ſhould bee diſturb'd, and the States of <hi>Italy</hi> diſorder'd, to bee able ſafely to maſter part of them, which he then found eaſie to doe, ſeeing the <hi>Venetians</hi> upon three conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations had us'd the meanes to bring the <hi>French</hi> men back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into <hi>Italy:</hi> which hee not only did not withſtand, but fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd, with a reſolution of King <hi>Lewis</hi> his ancient marriage. The King then paſt into <hi>Italy</hi> with the <hi>Venetians</hi> ayd, and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:12126:30"/> conſent; nor was hee ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner arriv'd in <hi>Milan,</hi> than the Pope had ſouldiers from him for the ſervice of <hi>Romania,</hi> which was quickly yeelded up to him upon the reputation of the Kings for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The Duke then having made himſelfe maſter of <hi>Romania,</hi> and beaten the <hi>Colonnies;</hi> deſiring to hold it, and proceed forward, two things hinder'd him: the one, his owne ſouldiers, which hee thought were not true to him; the other, the <hi>French</hi> mens good wills; that is to ſay, hee fear'd that the Princes ſouldiers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hee had ſerv'd himſelfe, would faile him, and not only hinder his conqueſt, but take from him what hee had gotten; and that the King alſo would ſerve him the ſame turne. Hee had experience of the <hi>Orſini</hi> upon an occaſion, when after the taking of <hi>Faenza,</hi> hee aſſaulted <hi>Bolonia,</hi> to which aſſault he ſaw them goe very cold. And touching the King, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverd his mind, when having

The Duke, when he had taken <hi>Romania,</hi> finding it had been under the hands of poor Lords, who had rather pillag'd their ſubjects, than chaſtis'd or amended them, giving them more cauſe of diſcord, than of peace and union, ſo that the whole country was fraught with rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries, quarrells, and all other ſorts of inſolencies; thought the beſt way to reduce them to termes of pacification, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to a Princely power, was, to give them ſome good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and therefore hee ſet over them one <hi>Remiro D' Orco,</hi> a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, haſty man, to whom he gave an abſolute power. This man in a very ſhort time ſetled peace and union amongſt them with very
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:12126:32"/> great reputation. Afterwards the Duke thought ſuch exceſſive au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ſerv'd not ſo well to his purpoſe, and doubting it would grow odious, he erected a Civill Iudicature in the midſt of the countrey, where one excellent Iudge did precide, and thither e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very City ſent their Advocate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and becauſe he knew the rigours paſt had bred ſome hatred againſt him, to purge the mindes of thoſe people, and to gaine them wholly to himſelfe, he purpos'd to ſhew, that if there was any cruelty uſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it proceeded not from any order of his, but from the harſh diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of his Officer. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on laying hold on him, at this occaſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee causd his head to bee ſtruck off one morning early in the market place at <hi>Ceſena,</hi> where hee was left upon a gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, with a bloodie ſword by his ſide; the cruelty of which ſpectacle for a while ſatisfied and amaz'd thoſe people. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne from whence wee have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsd:
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:12126:32"/> I ſay, that the Duke fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe very ſtrong, and in part out of doubt of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent dangers, becauſe hee was armd after his owne manner, and had in ſome good meaſure ſuppreſsd thoſe forces, which, becauſe of their vicinity, were able to annoy him, hee wanted nothing elſe to goe on with his Conqueſt, but the conſideration of <hi>France:</hi> for hee knew, that the King, who now, though late, was advisd of his errour, would never ſuffer him: and hereupon hee began to ſeeke after new al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyances, and to waver with <hi>France,</hi> when the <hi>French</hi> came towards <hi>Naples</hi> againſt the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> who then beſiegd <hi>Gaget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta;</hi> and his deſigne was onely to be out of their danger, which had been effected for him, had Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> liv'd. And thus were his buſineſſes carried touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his preſent eſtate. As for the future, hee had reaſon to doubt, leaſt the new ſucceſſor to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:12126:33"/> would not bee his friend, and would indeavour to take that from him that <hi>Alexander</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowd on him; and hee thought to provide for this fowre wayes: firſt by rooting out the races of all thoſe Lords hee had diſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, whereby to take thoſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from the Pope. Secondly, by gaining all the gentlemen of <hi>Rome,</hi> whereby he might be able with thoſe to keep the Pope i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Fourthly, by making of ſo large Conqueſts, before the Popes death, as that hee might be able of himſelfe to withſtand the firſt fury of his enemies. Three of theſe fowre at Pope <hi>Alexanders</hi> death hee had effected, and the fourth hee had neare brought to a point. For of thoſe Lords he had ſtripd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee put to death as many as hee could come at, and very few ſcap'd him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee gaind him the <hi>Romane</hi> gentlemen: and in the

And touching his new Conqueſt, hee had a deſigne to become Lord of <hi>Tuſcany.</hi> And he had poſſeſſed himſelfe already of <hi>Peruſia,</hi> and <hi>Piombin,</hi> and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken protection of <hi>Piſa:</hi> and ſo ſoone as hee ſhould have caſt of his reſpect to <hi>France</hi> (which now hee meant to hold no longer) being the <hi>French</hi> were now dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of the Kingdome of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> by the <hi>Spanyards,</hi> ſo, that each of them was forc'd to buy his friendſhip at any termes; he was then to leape into <hi>Piſa.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this <hi>Lucca</hi> and <hi>Siena,</hi> were preſently to fall to him, partly for envy to the <hi>Florentines,</hi> and partly for feare.

But <hi>Alexander</hi> dy'd five yeeres after that hee had begun to draw forth his ſword: and left him ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled only in the State of <hi>Romania,</hi> with all his other deſignes in the ayre, ſick unto death, between two very ſtrong armies of his enemies: and yet was there in this Duke ſuch a ſpirit and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and hee underſtood ſo well, how men are to be gaind, and how to be loſt, and ſo firme were the grounds hee had laid in a ſhort time, that, had hee not had thoſe armies upon his back, or had hee been in health, hee would have carried through his purpoſe in ſpight of all oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and that the foundations hee grounded upon, were good, it appeard in that <hi>Romania</hi> held for him above a month, and hee remaind ſecure in <hi>Rome,</hi> though even at deaths doore: and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:12126:34"/> the <hi>Baglioni, Vitelli,</hi> and <hi>Orſini</hi> came into <hi>Rome;</hi> yet found they none would take their parts againſt him. And this hee was able to have effected, that if hee could not have made him Pope whom hee would, he could have hindred him that hee would not ſhould bee Pope. But had hee been in health when <hi>Alexander</hi> dy'd, every thing had gone eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with him; and hee told mee on that day that <hi>Julius</hi> the ſecond was created Pope, that hee had fore-thought on all that which could happen, in caſe his father chanc'd to dye, and for every thing provided its remedy: this onely excepted, that hee foreſaw not that hee himſelfe ſhould at the ſame time be brought unto deaths dore alſo. Having then collected all the Dukes actions, me thinks I could not well blame him, but rather (as I have here done) ſet him as a patterne to be followd by all thoſe, who by fortune and others armes have
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:12126:35"/> been exalted to an Empire. For hee being of great courage, and having lofty deſignes, could not carry himſelfe otherwiſe; and the only obſtacle of his purpoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> was the brevity of <hi>Alexanders</hi> life, and his own ſickneſſe. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever therefore deemes it neceſſary in his entrance into a new Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality, to ſecure himſelfe of his enemies, and gaine him friends, to overcome either by force, or by cunning, to make himſelfe be belovd, or feard of his people, be follow'd and reverenc'd by his ſouldiers, to root out thoſe that can, or owe thee any hurt, to change the ancient orders with new wayes, to bee ſevere, and yet acceptable, magnanimous, and liberall, to extinguiſh the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull ſouldiery, and create new, to maintaine to himſelfe the amities of Kings and Princes, ſo that they ſhall either with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour benefit thee, or bee wary how to offend thee; cannot find more freſh and lively examples
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:12126:35"/> than the actions of this man. Hee deſerves to bee found fault withall for the creation of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> the ſecond, wherein an evill choice was made for him: for, as it is ſaid, not being able to make a Pope to his mind, hee could have with-held any one from being Pope; and ſhould never have conſented that any one of thoſe Cardinals, ſhould have got the Papacy, whom hee had ever done harme to; or who having attaind the Pontificate were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be afraid of him: becauſe men ordinarily doe hurt either for feare, or hatred. Thoſe whom hee had offended, were among others, hee who had the title of St. <hi>Peter ad Vincula, Colonna,</hi> St. <hi>George,</hi> and <hi>Aſcanius;</hi> all the others that were in poſſibility of the Popedome, were ſuch as might have feard him rather, except the Cardinall of <hi>Roan,</hi> and the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyards;</hi> theſe by reaſon of their alliance and obligation with him, the other, becauſe of the

Wherefore the Duke above all things ſhould have created a <hi>Spanyard</hi> Pope, and in caſe hee could not have done that, hee ſhould have agreed that <hi>Roan</hi> ſhould have been, and not St. <hi>Peter ad Vincula.</hi> And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever beleeves, that with great perſonages new benefits blot out the remembrance of old injuries, is much deceiv'd.

That can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not then be attributed to Fortune or Vertue, which without the one or th' other was attaind to by him. In our dayes, while <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixth held the ſea, <hi>Oliverotto</hi> of <hi>Fermo,</hi> who ſome few yeeres before had been left young by his parents, was brought up under the care of an uncle of his on the mothers ſide, calld <hi>John Foliani,</hi> and in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his youth given by him to ſerve in the warres under <hi>Paulo Vitelli:</hi> to the end that being well inſtructed in that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, hee might riſe to ſome worthy degree in the warrs. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards when <hi>Paulo</hi> was dead,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:12126:40"/> hee ſerved under <hi>Vitellozzo</hi> his brother, and in very ſhort time, being ingenious, of a good perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, and brave courage, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came one of the prime men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the troops he ſerved in: but thinking it but ſervile to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon another; hee plotted by the ayd of ſome Citizens of <hi>Fermo</hi> (who lik'd rather the thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of their City than the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of it) and by the favour of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>itelli,</hi> to make himſelfe maſter of <hi>Fermo;</hi> and writ to <hi>John Foliani,</hi> that having been many yeeres from home, he had a mind to come and ſee him and the City, and in ſome part take notice of his own patrimony; and becauſe he had not imployd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe but to purchaſe honour, to the end his Citizens might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that he had not vainely ſpent his time, he had a deſire to come in good equipage and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a hundred horſe of his friends and ſervants; and he intreated him that he would
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:12126:40"/> be pleaſd ſo to take order, that he might be honourably receivd by the inhabitants of <hi>Fermo;</hi> which turnd as well to his honour that was his uncle, as his that was the nephew. In this, <hi>John</hi> faild not in any office of courteſie due to his nephew: and caus'd him to be well receivd by them of <hi>Fermo,</hi> and lodgd him in his own houſe: where having paſſd ſome dayes, and ſtayd to put in order ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that was neceſſary for his intended villany, he made a very ſolemne feaſt, whether he invited <hi>John Foliani,</hi> and all the prime men of <hi>Fermo:</hi> and when all their cheare was ended, and all their other entertainments, as in ſuch feaſts it is cuſtomary, <hi>Oliverotto</hi> of purpoſe mov'd ſome grave diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes; ſpeaking of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Pope <hi>Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> his ſon, and their undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; whereunto <hi>John</hi> and the others making anſwer: he of a ſudden ſtood up, ſaying, that thoſe were things to be ſpoken of

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>itel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lozzo</hi> (whom he had had for maſter both of his vertues and vices.) Some man might doubt from whence it ſhould proceed, that <hi>Agathocles,</hi> and ſuch like, after many trecheryes and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes, could poſſibly live long ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in his own countrey, and defend himſelfe from his forren enemyes, and that never any of his own Citizens conſpir'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; ſeeing that by means of cruelty, many others have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been able even in peaceable times to maintaine their States, much leſſe in the doubtfull times of warre. I beleeve that this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the well, or ill uſing of thoſe crueltyes: they may bee termd well us'd (if it bee lawfull to ſay well of evill) that are put
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:12126:42"/> in practiſe only once of neceſſity for ſecurities ſake, not inſiſting therein afterwards, but there is uſe made of them for the ſubjects profit, as much as may be. But thoſe that are ill usd, are ſuch as though they bee but few in the beginning, yet they multiply ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in time, than deminiſh. They that take that firſt way, may with the help of God, and mens care, find ſome remedy for their State, as <hi>Agathocles</hi> did: for the others, it is impoſſible they ſhould continue. Whereupon it is to be noted, that in the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold of a State, the uſurper thereof ought to runne over and execute all his cruellties at once, that hee bee not forcd often to returne to them, and that hee may be able, by not renewing of them, to give men ſome ſecurity, and gaine their affections by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them ſome courteſies.

To this may be added alſo, that the Prince which is the peoples enemy, can never well ſecure himſelfe of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their multitude; well may hee bee ſure of the Nobles, they being but a few. The worſt that a Prince can look for of the people become his enemy, is, to be abandond by them: but when the great ones once grow his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemyes, he is not only to feare their abandoning of him, but their making of a party againſt him alſo: for there being i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:12126:44"/> alwayes take time by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks whereby to ſave themſelves, and ſeeke credit with him, who they hope ſhall get the maſtery. The Prince likewiſe is neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted alwayes to live with the ſame people, but can doe well enough without the ſame great men, he being able to create new ones, and deſtroy them againe every day, and to take from them, and give them credit as he pleaſes: and to cleare this part, I ſay, that great men ought to be conſiderd two wayes principally, that is, if they take thy proceedings ſo much to heart, as to ingage their fortunes wholly in thine, in caſe they lye not alwayes catching at ſpoyle, they ought to bee well honourd and eſteem'd: thoſe that bind themſelves not to thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, are to be conſiderd alſo two wayes; either they doe it for lack of courage,, and naturall want of ſpirit, and then ſhouldſt thou ſerve thy ſelfe of them, and of them eſpecially that are men of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:12126:45"/> good advice; for if thy affaires proſper, thou doſt thy ſelf honor thereby; if croſt, thou needſt not feare them: but when they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige not themſelves to thee of purpoſe, and upon occaſion of ambition, it is a ſigne they think more of themſelves than of thee: and of theſe the Prince ought to beware, and account of them as his diſcoverd enemyes: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in thy adverſity they will give a hand too to ruine thee. Therefore ought hee that comes to be Prince by the peoples fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, keepe them his friends: which he may eaſily doe, they deſiring only to live free from oppreſſion: but he that becomes Prince by the great mens favour, againſt the will of the people, ought above all things to gaine the people to him, which he may eaſily effect, when he takes upon him their protection: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men when they find good, where they look for evill, are thereby more endeard to their
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:12126:45"/> benefactour, therefore growes the people ſo pliant in their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to him, as if by their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours he had attaind his dignity. And the Prince is able to gaine them to his ſide by many wayes, which becauſe they vary accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſubject, no certaine rule can bee given thereupon, wherefore we ſhall let them paſſe; I will only conclude, that it is neceſſary for a Prince to have the people his friend, otherwiſe in his adverſities he hath no helpe. <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis</hi> Prince of the <hi>Spartans</hi> ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſiege of all <hi>Greece,</hi> and an exceeding victorious army of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and againſt thoſe defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his native countrey and State, and this ſuffic'd him alone, that as the danger came upon him, he ſecur'd himſelfe of a few: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if the people had been his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, this had nothing availd him. And let no man think to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw this my opinon with that common proverb, that he who relyes upon the people, layes his
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:12126:46"/> foundation in the dirt; for that is true, where a private Citizen grounds upon them, making his account that the people ſhall free him, when either his enemyes or the Magiſtrates oppreſſe him. In this caſe he ſhould find himſelfe often deceiv'd, as it befell the <hi>Gracehyes</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> and in <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence George Scali:</hi> but he being a Prince that grounds thereupon, who can command, and is a man of courage, who hath his wits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him in his adverſityes, and wants not other preparations, and holds together the whole multitude animated with his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and orders, ſhall not prove deceiv'd by them, and ſhall find he hath layd good foundations. Theſe Principalityes are wont to be upon the point of falling when they goe about to skip from the civill order, to the abſolute: for theſe Princes either command of themſelves, or by the Magiſtrats; in this laſt caſe their State is more weak and dangerous: becauſe
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:12126:46"/> they ſtand wholly at the will and pleaſure of theſe Citizens, who then are ſet over the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, who eſpecially in adverſe times are able with facility to take their State from them, either by riſing up againſt them, or by not obeying them; and then the Prince is not at hand in thoſe dangers to take the abſolute au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority upon him: for the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens and ſubjects that are accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to receive the commands from the Magiſtrates, are not like in thoſe fractions to obey his: and in doubtfull times hee ſhall alwayes have greateſt penury of whom hee may truſt; for ſuch a Prince cannot ground upon that which he ſees in peaceable times, when the Citizens have need of the State; for then every one runs and every one promiſes, and every one will venture his life for him, when there is no danger neare; but in times of hazzard, when the State hath need of Citizens, there are but few of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:12126:47"/> them then, and ſo much the more is this experience dangerours, in that it can be but once made. Therefore a prudent Prince ought to deviſe a way, whereby his Citizens alwayes and in any caſe and quality of time may have need of his government, and they ſhall alwaies after proove faithfull to him.</p>

               <p>IT is requiſite in examining the quality of thoſe Principalities, to have another conſideration of them, that is, if a Prince have ſuch dominions, that hee is able in caſe of neceſſity to ſubſiſt of himſelfe, or elſe whether hee hath alwaies need of another to defend him. And to cleer this point the better, I judge them able to ſtand of themſelves, who are of power either for their multitudes of men, or quantity of money, to bring into the feild a compleat armie, and joyne battell with
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:12126:47"/> whoever comes to aſſaile them: and ſo I think thoſe alwayes to ſtand in need of others help, who are not able to appear in the feild againſt the enemy, but are forc'd to retire within their walls and guard them. Touching the firſt caſe, wee have treated already, and ſhall adde ſomewhat thereto as occaſion ſhall require. In the ſecond caſe, wee cannot ſay other, ſave only to incourage ſuch Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to fortifie and guard their own Capitall city, and of the countrey about not to hold much account; and whoever ſhall have well fortifi'd that towne, and touching other matters of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments ſhall have behav'd himſelfe towards his ſubjects, as hath been formerly ſaid, and hereafter ſhall bee, ſhall never be aſſaild but with great regard; for men willingly undertake not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes, where they ſee difficulty to work them through; nor can much facility bee there found, where one aſſailes him, who hath
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:12126:48"/> his towne ſtrong and well guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and is not hated of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The cities of <hi>Germany</hi> are very free; they have but very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the countrey about them belonging to them, and they obey the Emperour, when they pleaſe, and they ſtand not in fear, neither of him nor any other po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate about them: for they are in ſuch a manner fortifi'd, that every one thinks the ſiege of any of them would proove hard and tedious: for all of them have ditches and rampires, and good ſtore of Artillery, and alwayes have their publick ſellers well provided with meat and drink and firing for a yeere: beſides this whereby to feed the common people, and without any loſſe to the publick, they have alwayes in common whereby they are able for a yeere to imploy them in the labour of thoſe trades, that are the ſinews and the life of that city, and of that induſtry, whereby the commons ordinarily
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:12126:48"/> ſupported themſelves: they hold up alſo the military exerciſes in repute, and hereupon have they many orders to maintaine them. A Prince then that is maſter of a good ſtrong city, and cauſeth not himſelfe to be hated, cannot bee aſſaulted; and in caſe hee were, he that ſhould aſſaile him, would be faine to quitt him with ſhame: for the affayres of the world are ſo various, that it is almoſt impoſſible that an army can lye incampt before a towne for the ſpace of a whole yeere: and if any ſhould reply, that the people having their poſſeſſions abroad, in caſe they ſhould ſee them afire, would not have pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and the tedious ſiege and their love to themſelves would make them forget their Prince: I anſwer that a Prince puiſſant and couragious, will eaſily ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter thoſe difficulties, now giving his ſubjects hope, that the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe will not bee of durance, ſometimes affrighting them with
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:12126:49"/> the cruelty of their enemies, and otherwhiles cunningly ſecuring himſelf of thoſe, whom he thinks too forward to runne to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy. Beſides this by ordinary reaſon the enemy ſhould burne and waſte their country upon his arrivall, and at thoſe times while mens minds are yet warme, and reſolute in their defence: and therefore ſo much the leſſe ought a Prince doubt: for after ſome few dayes, that their courages grow coole, the dammages are all done, and miſchiefes receivd, and there is no help for it, and then have they more occaſion to cleave faſter to their Prince; thinking hee is now more bound to them, their houſes having for his defence been fir'd, and their poſſeſſions waſted: and mens nature is as well to hold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves oblig'd for the kindneſſes they doe, as for thoſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; whereupon if all bee well weigh'd, a wiſe Prince ſhall not find much difficulty to keep ſure

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:12126:50"/> them; nor their ſubjects, though not govern'd, care not, think not, neither are able to aliene them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from them. Theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities then are only happy and ſecure: but they being ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by ſuperiour cauſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto humane underſtanding reaches not, I will not meddle with them: for being ſet up and maintaind by God; it would be the part of a preſumptuous and raſh man to enter into diſcourſe of them. Yet if any man ſhould aske mee whence it proceeds, that the Church in temporall power hath attaind to ſuch great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſeeing that till the time of <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixt, the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> potentates, and not only they who are entitled potentates, but every Baron and Lord though of the meaneſt condition, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the temporality made but ſmall account of it, and now a King of <hi>France</hi> trembles at the power thereof, and it hath been able to drive him out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:12126:50"/> ruine the <hi>Venetians;</hi> and however this bee well known, me thinks it is not ſuperfluous in ſome part to recall it to memory. Before that <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> paſt into <hi>Italy,</hi> this countrey was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the rule of the Pope, the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians,</hi> the King of <hi>Naples,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> and the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines.</hi> Theſe potentates took two things principally to their care; the one, that no forreiner ſhould invade <hi>Italy;</hi> the other, that no one of them ſhould inlarge their State. They, againſt whom this care was moſt taken, were the Pope and the <hi>Venetians;</hi> and to reſtraine the <hi>Venetians,</hi> there nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the union of all the reſt, as it was in the defence of <hi>Ferrara;</hi> and to keep the Pope low, they ſervd themſelves of the Barons of <hi>Rome,</hi> who being devided into two facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the <hi>Orſini</hi> and <hi>Colonneſi,</hi> there was alwayes occaſion of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence between them, who ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready with their armes in hand in the view of the Pope,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:12126:51"/> held the Popedome weak and feeble: and however ſometimes there aroſe a couragious Pope, as was <hi>Sextus;</hi> yet either his fortune, or his wiſdome was not able to free him of theſe incommodities, and the brevity of their lives was the cauſe thereof: for in ten yeers, which time one with another, the Popes ordinarily liv'd, with much adoe could they bring low one of the factions. And if, as as wee may ſay, one had near put out the <hi>Colonneſi,</hi> there aroſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enemy to the <hi>Orſini,</hi> who made them grow againe, ſo that there was never time quite to root them out. This then was the cauſe, why the Popes temporall power was of ſmall eſteeme in <hi>Italy.</hi> There aroſe afterwards Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixt, who of all the Popes that ever were, ſhewd what a Pope was able to doe with money and forces: and hee effected by meanes of his inſtrument, Duke <hi>Valentins,</hi> and by the occaſion of the <hi>French</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:12126:51"/> mens paſſage, all thoſe things, which I have formerly diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon in the Dukes actions: and however his purpoſe was nothing at all to inlarge the Church dominions, but to make the Duke great; yet what hee did, turnd to the Churches ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; which after his death, when the Duke was taken away, was the heire of all his paines. Afterwards ſucceeded Pope <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> and found the Church great, having all <hi>Romania,</hi> and all the Barons of <hi>Rome</hi> being quite roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out, and by <hi>Alexanders</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions all their factions worne down; hee found alſo the way open for the heaping up of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes, never practis'd before <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexanders</hi> time; which things <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> not only follow'd, but aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented; and thought to make himſelfe maſter of <hi>Bolonia,</hi> and extinguiſh the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and chaſe the <hi>French</hi> men out of <hi>Italy:</hi> and theſe deſignes of his prov'd all lucky to him, and ſo much
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:12126:52"/> the more to his praiſe in that he did all for the good of the Church, and in no private re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard: hee kept alſo the factions of the <hi>Orſini,</hi> and <hi>Colonneſi,</hi> in the ſame State hee found them: and though there were among them ſome head whereby to cauſe an alteration; yet two things have held them quiet, the one the power of the Church, which ſomewhat affrights them; the other becauſe they have no Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals of their factions, who are the primary cauſes of all the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles amongſt them: nor ſhall theſe parties ever bee at reſt, while they have Cardinals; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they nouriſh the factions both in <hi>Rome,</hi> and abroad, and and the Barons then are forc'd to undertake the defence of them: and thus from the Prelates ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ariſe the diſcords and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults among the Barons. And now hath Pope <hi>Leo</hi> his Holineſſe found the Popedome exceeding puiſſant, of whome it is hop'd,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:12126:52"/> that if they amplifi'd it by armes, hee by his goodneſſe, and infinite other vertues, will much more advantage and dignifie it.</p>

               <p>HAving treated particularly of the qualities of thoſe Principalities, which in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning I propounded to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon, and conſidered in ſome part the reaſons of their well and ill being, and ſhewed the wayes whereby many have ſought to gaine, and hold them; it remaines now that I ſpeak in generall of the offences and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, that may chance in each of the forenamed. We have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſaid that it is neceſſary for a Prince to have good foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons laid; otherwiſe it muſt needs bee that hee goe to wrack. The principall foundations that all

I ſay then that the armes, wherewithall a Prince defends his State, either are his own, or mercenary, or auxiliary, or mixt. Thoſe that are merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and auxiliary, are unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and dangerous; and if any one holds his State founded upon mercenary armes, hee ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be quiet, nor ſecure: becauſe they are never well united, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and without diſcipline, treacherous, among their friends ſtout, among their enemies co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, they have no feare of God, nor keep any faith with men, and ſo long only deferre they the doing of miſchiefe, till the enemy comes to aſſayle thee, and in time of peace thou art di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoyld

Touching merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary armes that were of old, we have an example of the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians,</hi> who neare upon were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsd by their owne mercenary ſouldiers, when the firſt warre with the <hi>Romans</hi> was finiſhd, however the <hi>Carthagians</hi> had their owne Citizens for their Captaines. <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> was made by the <hi>Thebans</hi> after
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:12126:55"/> 
                  <hi>Epaminondas</hi> his death, Generall of their Armies; and after the victory, he took from them their liberty. The <hi>Milaneſes</hi> when Duke <hi>Philip</hi> was dead, entertaind <hi>Francis Sforza</hi> into their pay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who having vanquiſht their enemies at <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaggio,</hi> afterwards joyned with them, whereby to uſurp upon the <hi>Milaneſes</hi> his Maſters. <hi>Sforza</hi> his father, being in <hi>Joane</hi> the Queen of <hi>Naples</hi> pay, left her on a ſudden diſarmd; whereupon ſhe, to ſave her Kingdome, was conſtraind to caſt her ſelfe into the King of <hi>Arragon's</hi> boſome. And in caſe the <hi>Venetians</hi> and the <hi>Florentines</hi> have formerly aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented their State with theſe kinde of Armes, and their owne Captaines, and yet none of them have ever made themſelves their Princes, but rather defended them: I anſwer, that the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> in this caſe have had Fortune much their friend: for of valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Captains, which they might
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:12126:55"/> any way feare, ſome have not been victors, ſome have had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and others have layd the ayme of their ambitions ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way. Hee who overcame not, was <hi>John Aeuto,</hi> of whoſe faith there could no proofe bee made, being he vanquiſht not; but every one will acknowledge, that, had he vanquiſht, the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines</hi> were at his diſcretion. <hi>Sforza</hi> had alwayes the <hi>Bracceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi</hi> for his adverſaries, ſo that they were as a guard one upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. <hi>Francis</hi> converted all his ambition againſt <hi>Lombardy. Brac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio</hi> againſt the Church, and the Kingdome of <hi>Naples.</hi> But let us come to that, which followed a while agoe. The <hi>Florentines</hi> made <hi>Paul <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>itelli</hi> their General, a throughly advisd man, and who from a private fortune had roſe to very great reputation: had he taken <hi>Piſa,</hi> no man will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but that the <hi>Florentines</hi> muſt have held faſt with him; for had he been entertaind in their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:12126:56"/> pay, they had had no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and they themſelves holding of him, of force were to obey him. The <hi>Venetians,</hi> if wee conſider their proceedings, wee ſhall ſee wrought both warily and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, while they themſelves made warre, which was before their undertakings by land where the gentlemen with their own Commons in armes behav'd themſelves bravely: but when they began to fight by land, they loſt their valour, and follow'd the cuſtomes of <hi>Italy;</hi> and in the beginning of their inlargement by land, becauſe they had not much territory, and yet were of great reputation, they had not much cauſe to feare their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines; but as they began to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their bounds, which was under their Commander <hi>Carmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niola,</hi> they had a taſte of this error: for perceiving hee was exceeding valourous, having under his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct beaten the Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> and knowing on the other ſide,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:12126:56"/> how hee was cold in the warre, they judg'd that they could not make any great conqueſt with him; and becauſe they neither would, nor could not caſhier him, that they might not loſe what they had gotten, they were forc'd for their owne ſafeties to put him to death.

You have to underſtand, that ſo ſoone as in theſe later times the yoak of the <hi>Italian</hi> Empire began to be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, and the Pope had gotten reputation in the temporalty, <hi>Italy</hi> was divided into ſeverall States: for many of the great ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties took armes againſt their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; who under the Emperours protection had held them in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; and the Pope favourd theſe, whereby he might get him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe reputation, in the temporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; of many others, their Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens became Princes, ſo that hereupon <hi>Italy</hi> being come into the Churches hands as it were, and ſome few Republicks, thoſe Prieſts and Citizens not accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the uſe of armes, began to take ſtrangers to their pay. The firſt that gave reputation to theſe ſouldiers was <hi>Alberick</hi> of <hi>Como</hi> in <hi>Romania.</hi> From his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline among others deſcended <hi>Brachio</hi> and <hi>Sforza,</hi> who in their
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:12126:57"/> time were the arbitres of <hi>Italy.</hi> After theſe followd all the others, who even til our dayes have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the armes of <hi>Italy:</hi> and the ſucceſſe of their valour hath been, that it was overrunne by <hi>Charles,</hi> pillagd by <hi>Lewis,</hi> forc'd by <hi>Fardinand,</hi> and diſgrac'd by the <hi>Swiſſers.</hi> The order which they have held, hath been, firſt whereby to give reputation to their owne armes, to take away the credit of the infantrey. This they did, becauſe they having no State of their owne, but living upon their induſtry, their few foot gave them no reputation, and many they were not able to maintaine, whereupon they reduc'd themſelves to <hi>cavalery,</hi> and ſo with a ſupportable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber they were intertaind and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourd: and matters were brought to ſuch termes, that in an army of twenty thouſand ſouldiers, you ſhould not find two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand foot.

               <p>THe Auxiliary forces, being the other kind of unprofitable armes, are, when any puiſſant one is cal'd in, who with his forces comes to aſſiſt and defend thee; ſuch as in theſe later times did Pope <hi>Julius</hi> uſe, who having
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:12126:58"/> ſeen the evill proof of his merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſouldiers in the enterprize of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> appli'd himſelfe to the Auxiliaries, and agreed with <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that with his forces hee ſhould ayd him. Theſe armes may be profitable and advantagious for themſelves; but for him that calls them in, hurtfull; becauſe in loſing, thou art left defeated; and conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, thou becomeſt their priſoner. And however that of theſe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples the ancient ſtories are full fraught, yet will I not part from this of Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the ſecond, which is as yet freſh: whoſe courſe could not have been more incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate, for the deſire hee had to get <hi>Ferrara,</hi> putting himſelfe wholly into ſtrangers hands: but his good fortune, cauſd another third cauſe to ariſe, that hindred him from receiving the fruit of his evill choice; for his Auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries being broken at <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and the <hi>Swiſſers</hi> thereupon arriving, who put the Conquerours to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:12126:59"/> flight, beyond all opinion even their owne and others, he chanc'd not to remaine his enemies pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, they being put to flight; nor priſoner to his Auxiliaries, having vanquiſhd by other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, than theirs. The <hi>Florentines</hi> being wholly diſarmd, brought ten thouſand <hi>French</hi> to <hi>Piſa</hi> for to take it: by which courſe they ran more hazzard, than in any time of their troubles. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe his neighbours, brought into <hi>Greece</hi> ten thouſond <hi>Turks,</hi> who when the warre was ended, could not bee got out thence, which was the beginning of <hi>Greeces</hi> ſervitude under the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels. He then that will in no caſe be able to overcome, let him ſerve himſelfe of theſe armes; for they are much more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than the mercenaries; for by thoſe thy ruine is more ſuddenly executed; for they are all united, and all bent to the obedience of another. But for the mercenaries
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:12126:59"/> to hurt thee, when they have van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhd, there is no more need of time, and greater occaſion, they not being all united in a body, and being found out and paid by thee, wherein a third that thou mak'ſt their head, cannot ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gaine ſo great authority, that hee can endammage thee. In ſumme, in the mercenaries their ſloth and lazineſſe to fight is more dangerous: in the auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries their valour. Wherefore a wiſe Prince hath alwayes avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded theſe kind of armes, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken himſelfe to his owne, and deſird rather to loſe with his owne, than conquer with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, accounting that not a true victorie, which was gotten with others armes. I will not doubt to alleadge <hi>Caeſar Borgia,</hi> and his actions. This Duke entred into <hi>Romania</hi> with auxiliarie armes, bringing with him all <hi>French</hi> ſouldiers: but afterwards not accounting thoſe armes ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, bent himſelfe to mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:12126:60"/> judging leſſe danger to be in thoſe, and tooke in pay the <hi>Orſini</hi> and the <hi>Vetelli,</hi> which afterwards in the proof of them, finding wavering, unfaithfull, and dangerous, hee extinguiſhd, and betook himſelfe to his owne; and it may eaſily be perceiv'd, what difference there is between the one and the other of theſe armes, conſidering the difference that was between the Dukes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, when he had the <hi>French</hi> men alone, and when he had the <hi>Orſini</hi> and <hi>Vetelli;</hi> but when he remaind with his own, and ſtood of himſelfe, wee ſhall find it was much augmented: nor ever was it of great eſteeme, but when every one ſaw, that hee wholly poſſesd his owne armes. I thought not to have parted from the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> examples of late memory; but that I muſt not let paſſe that of <hi>Hiero</hi> the <hi>Siracuſan,</hi> being one of thoſe I formerly nam'd. This man (as I ſaid before) being made generall of the <hi>Siracuſans</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:12126:60"/> forces, knew preſently that that mercenary ſouldiery was nothing for their profit, in that they were hirelings, as our <hi>Jtalians</hi> are; and finding no way either to hold, or caſhier them, made them all bee cut to peeces, and afterwards wag'd warre with his owne men, and none others. I will alſo call to memory a figure of the old Teſtament ſerving juſt to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. When <hi>David</hi> preſented himſelfe before <hi>Saul</hi> to goe to fight with <hi>Goliah</hi> the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> Champion; <hi>Saul</hi> to incourage him, clad him with his owne armes, which <hi>David</hi> when hee had them upon his back, refus'd, ſaying, he was not able to make any proofe of himſelfe therein, and therefore would goe meet the enemy with his own ſting and ſword. In ſumme, others armes either fall from thy ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or cumber or ſtreighten thee. <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeaventh, Father of <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh, having by his good fortune &amp; valour ſet <hi>France</hi>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:12126:61"/> at liberty from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> knew well this neceſſity of being arm'd with his owne armes, and ſettled in his Kingdome the ordinances of men at armes, and infantry. Afterwards King <hi>Lewis</hi> his ſonne aboliſhd thoſe of the infantry, and began to take the <hi>Swiſſers</hi> to pay; which errour follow'd by the others, is (as now in deed it appeares) the cauſe of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes dangers. For having given reputation to the <hi>Swiſſers,</hi> they have renderd all their own armes contemptible; for this hath whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ruind their foot, and oblig'd their men at armes to forrein armes: for being accuſtomed to ſerve with the <hi>Swiſſers,</hi> they think they are not able to overcome without them. From whence it comes that the <hi>French</hi> are not of force againſt the <hi>Swiſſers,</hi> and without them alſo againſt others they uſe not to adventure. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are the <hi>French</hi> armies mixt, part mercenaries, and part natives, which armes are farre better than
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:12126:61"/> the ſimple mercenaries or ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple auxiliaries, and much inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to the natives; and let the ſaid example ſuffice for that: for the Kingdome of <hi>France</hi> would have been unconquerable, if <hi>Charles</hi> his order had been aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented and maintaind: but men in their ſmall wiſdome begin a thing, which then becauſe it hath ſome ſavour of good, diſcovers not the poyſon, that lurkes there under, as I before ſaid of the hectick feavers. Wherefore that Prince which perceives not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes, but as they grow up, is not truely wiſe; and this is given but to few: and if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the firſt ruine of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Empire, wee ſhall find it was, from taking the <hi>Goths</hi> firſt into their pay; for from that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning the forces of the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire began to grow weak, and all the valour that was taken hence was given to them. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude then that without having armes of their owne, no Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:12126:62"/> can be ſecure, or rather is wholly oblig'd to fortune, not having valour to ſhelter it in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity. And it was alwayes the opinion and ſaying of wiſe men, that nothing is ſo weak and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetled, as is the reputation of power not founded upon ones owne proper forces: which are thoſe that are composd of thy ſubjects, or Citizens, or ſervants; all the reſt are mercenary or auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary; and the manner how to order thoſe well, is eaſie to find out, if thoſe orders above nam'd by me, ſhall be but run over, and if it ſhall be but conſider'd, how <hi>Philip Alexander</hi> the Great his Father, and in what manner ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Republicks and Princes have armd and appointed themſelves, to which appointments I referre my ſelfe wholly.</p>

               <p>A Prince then ought to have no other ayme, nor other thought, nor take any thing elſe for his proper arte, but warr, and the orders and diſcipline thereof: for that is the ſole arte which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to him that commands, and is of ſo great excellency, that not only thoſe that are borne Princes, it maintains ſo; but many times rayſes men from a private fortune to that dignity. And it is ſeene by the contrary, that when Princes have given them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more to their delights, than to the warres, they have loſt their States; and the firſt cauſe that makes thee loſe it, is the neglect of that arte; and the cauſe that makes thee gaine it, is that thou art experienc'd and approv'd in that arte. <hi>Francis Sforza</hi> by being a man at armes, of a private man
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:12126:63"/> became Duke of <hi>Milan;</hi> and his ſons by excuſing themſelves of the troubles and paines belonging to thoſe imployments of Princes, became private men. For among other miſchiefes thy neglect of armes brings upon thee, it cauſes thee to be contemnd, which is one of thoſe diſgraces, from which a Prince ought to keepe himſelfe, as hereafter ſhall bee ſayd: for from one that is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armd to one that is armd there is no proportion; and reaſon will not, that he who is in armes, ſhould willingly yeeld obedience to him that is unfurniſhd of them, &amp; that he that is diſarmd ſhould be in ſecurity among his armed vaſſalls; for there being diſdaine in the one, and ſuſpicion in the other it is impoſſible theſe ſhould ever well co-operate. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Prince who is quite unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd in matter of warre, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the other infelicities belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, as is ſaid, cannot bee had in any eſteeme among his
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:12126:63"/> ſouldiers, nor yet truſt in them. Wherefore he ought never to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the practice of the arte of warre, and in time of peace ſhould he exerciſe it more than in the warre; which he may bee able to doe two wayes, the one practically, and in his labours &amp; recreations of his body, the other theorically. And touching the practick part, hee ought beſides the keeping of his own ſubjects well traind up in the diſcipline and excerciſe of armes, give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe much to the chaſe, whereby to accuſtome his body to paines, and partly to underſtand the manner of ſituations, &amp; to know how the mountaines ariſe, which way the vallyes open themſelves, and how the plaines are diſtended flat abroad, and to conceive well the nature of the rivers, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh ground, and herein to beſtow very much care, which know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is profitable in two kinds: firſt he learnes thereby to know his own countrey, and is the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:12126:64"/> enabled to underſtand the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence thereof, and afterwards by meanes of his knowledge and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in theſe ſituations eaſily comprehend any other ſituation, which a new hee hath need to view, for the little hillocks, val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, plaines, rivers, and marriſh places. For example, they in <hi>Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cany</hi> are like unto thoſe of other countries: ſo that from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ſite of one country, it is eaſie to attain to know that of others. And that Prince that wants this skill, failes of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall part a Commander ſhould be furniſht with: for this ſhows the way, how to diſcover the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, to pitch the camp, to lead their armies, to order their bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells, and alſo to beſiege a town at thy beſt advantage. <hi>Philopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> Prince of the <hi>Achayans,</hi> among other prayſes writers give him, they ſay, that in time of peace, he thought not upon any thing ſo much as the practiſe of warre; and whenſoever he was
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:12126:64"/> abroad in the field to diſport himſelfe with his friends, would often ſtand ſtill, and diſcourſe with them, in caſe the enemies were upon the top of that hill, and we here with our army, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of us two ſhould have the advantage, and how might wee ſafely goe to find them, keeping ſtill our orders? and if we would retire our ſelves, what courſe ſhould we take? if they retir'd, how ſhould wee follow them? and thus on the way propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them all ſuch accidents could befall in an army; would heare their opinions, and tell his own, and confirme it by argument, ſo that by his continuall thought hereupon, when ever he led any army, no chance could happen, for which he had not a remedy. But touching the exerciſe of the mind, a Prince ought to reade Hiſtories, and in them conſider the actions of the worthieſt men, marke how they have behav'd themſelves in the warrs, examine
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:12126:65"/> the occaſions of their victories, and their loſſes; whereby they may be able to avoyd theſe, and obtaine thoſe; and above all, doe as formerly ſome excellent man hath done, who hath taken upon him to imitate, if any one that hath gone before him, hath left his memory glorious; the courſe he took, and kept alwaies neare unto him the remembrances of his actions and worthy deeds: as it is ſaid, that <hi>Alexander</hi> the great imitated <hi>Achilles; Caeſar Alexander;</hi> and <hi>Scipio Cyrus.</hi> And whoever reads the life of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> written by <hi>Xenophon,</hi> may eaſily perceive afterwards in <hi>Scipio's</hi> life, how much glory his imitation gaind him, and how much <hi>Scipio</hi> did conforme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in his chaſtity, affability, humanity, and liberality with thoſe things, that are written by <hi>Xenophon</hi> of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Such like wayes ought a wiſe Prince to take, nor ever be idle in quiet times: but by his paines then, as it were

               <p>IT now remaines that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, what the conditions of a Prince ought to be, and his termes of government over his ſubjects, and towards his friends. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I know that many have written hereupon; I doubt, leſt I venturing alſo to treat thereof, may be branded with preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, eſpecially ſeeing I am like enough to deliver an opinion dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from others. But my intent being to write for the advantage of him that underſtands mee, I thought it fitter to follow the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall truth of the matter, than
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:12126:66"/> the imagination thereof: And many Principalities and Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, have been in imagination, which neither have been ſeen nor knowne to be indeed: for there is ſuch a diſtance between how men doe live, and how men ought to live; that hee who leaves that which is done, for that which ought to bee done, learnes ſooner his ruine, than his preſervation: for that man who will profeſſe honeſty in all his actions, muſt needs goe to ruine, among ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that are diſhoneſt. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it is neceſſary for a Prince, deſiring to preſerve himſelfe, to be able to make uſe of that hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, and to lay it aſide againe, as need ſhall require. Paſſing by then things that are only in ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination belonging to a Prince, to diſcourſe upon thoſe that are really true; I ſay that all men, whenſoever mention is made of them, and eſpecially Princes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are placd aloft in the view of all, are taken notice of,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:12126:66"/> for ſome of theſe qualities, which procure them either commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or blame: &amp; this is, that ſome one is held liberal, ſome miſerable, (miſerable I ſay, not covetous, for the covetous deſire to have, though it were by rapine, but a miſerable man is he, that too much forbears to make uſe of his owne) ſome free givers, others extortioners; ſome cruell, others pittious; the one a League breaker, another faithfull; the one effeminate and of ſmall courage, the other fierce and couragious; the one courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, the other proud; the one laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civious, the other chaſte; the one of faire dealing, the other wily and crafty; the one hard, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eaſie; the one grave, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther light; the one religious, the other incredulous, and ſuch like. I know that every one will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, it were exceedingly praiſe-worthy for a Prince to be ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with all theſe above nam'd qualities that are good: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this is not poſſible, nor doe
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:12126:67"/> humane conditions admit ſuch perfection in vertues, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for him to be ſo diſcreet, that he know how to avoid the infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of thoſe vices, which would thruſt him out of his State; and if it be poſſible, beware of thoſe alſo which are not able to remove him thence; but where it cannot bee, let them paſſe with leſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard. And yet, let him not ſtand much upon it, though he incurre the infamie of thoſe vices, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which hee can very hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſave his State: for if all bee throughly conſiderd, ſome things we ſhall find which will have the colour and very face of Vertue, and following them, they will lead thee to thy deſtruction; whereas ſome others, that ſhall as much ſeeme vice, if we take the courſe they lead us, ſhall diſcover unto us the way to our ſafety and well-being.</p>

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:12126:67"/> Chapter: where he inſtructs his Prince to uſe ſuch an ambidex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity as that he may ſerve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, either of vertue, or vice, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his advantage, which in true pollicy is neither good in attaining the Principality, nor in ſecuring it when it is attaind. For Politicks preſuppoſe Ethiques, which will never allow this rule: as that a man might make this ſmall difference between vertue, and vice, that he may indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lay aſide, or take up the one, or the other, and put it in practiſe as beſt conduceth to the end he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds himſelfe.

                  <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> Of Liberality, and Miſerableneſſe.</head>
               <p>BEginning then at the firſt of the above mentioned quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, I ſay, that it would be very well to be accounted liberall: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe, liberality uſed in ſuch a manner, as to make thee be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ſo, wrongs thee: for in caſe it be uſed vertuouſly, and as it ought to be, it ſhall never come to be taken notice of, ſo as to free thee from the infamie of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:12126:68"/> And therefore for one to hold the name of liberall among men, it were needfull not to omit any ſumptuous quality, inſomuch that a Prince alwayes ſo diſpoſd, ſhall waſte all his revenues, and at the end ſhall be forc'd, if he will ſtill maintaine that reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of liberality, heavily to burthen his ſubjects, and become a great exactour; and put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe all thoſe things, that can be done to get mony. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to make him hatefull to his ſubjects, and fall into every ones contempt, growing neceſſitous: ſo that having with this his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality wrong'd many, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted of his bounty but to a few, he feeles every firſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance, and runnes a hazzard of every firſt danger. Which he knowing, and deſiring to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himſelfe from, incurrs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the diſgrace of being termd miſerable. A Prince therefore not being able to uſe this vertue of liberality, without his owne
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:12126:69"/> dammage, in ſuch a ſort, that it may be taken notice of, ought, if he be wiſe, not to regard the name of Miſerable; for in time he ſhall alwayes be eſteemed the more liberall, ſeeing that by his parſimony his owne revenues are ſufficient for him, as alſo he can defend himſelfe againſt whoever makes warre againſt him, and can doe ſome exploits without grieving his ſubjects: ſo that he comes to uſe his liberality to all thoſe, from whom he takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, who are infinite in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and his miſerableneſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe, to whom hee gives nothing, who are but a few. In our dayes wee have not ſeen any, but thoſe who have been held miſerable, doe any great matters, but the others all quite ruind. Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the ſecond, however he ſerv'd himſelfe of the name of Liberall, to get the Papacy, yet never intended he to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue it, to the end hee might bee able to make warre againſt the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:12126:69"/> King of <hi>France;</hi> and hee made ſo many wars without impoſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny extraordinary taxe; becauſe his long thrift ſupplyd his large expences. This preſent King of <hi>Spain</hi> could never have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, nor gone through with ſo many exployts, had he been accounted liberall. Wherefore a Prince ought little to regard (that hee may not be driven to pillage his ſubjects, that he may be able to defend himſelfe, that he may not fall into poverty and contempt, that he be not forcd to become an extortioner) though he incurre the name of Miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for this is one of thoſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which does not pluck him from his throne. And if any one ſhould ſay; <hi>Caeſar</hi> by his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality obtaind the Empire, and many others (becauſe they both were, and were eſteemd liberall) attaind to exceeding great dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. I anſwer, either thou art already come to be a Prince, or thou art in the way to it: in the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:12126:70"/> firſt caſe this liberality is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; in the ſecone it is neceſſary to be accounted ſo; and <hi>Caeſar</hi> was one of thoſe that aſpird to the Principality of <hi>Rome.</hi> But if after he had gotten it, he had ſurvivd, and not forborne thoſe expences, hee would quite have ruind that Empire. And if any one ſhould reply; many have been Princes, and with their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies have done great exployts, who have been held very libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. I anſwer, either the Prince ſpends of his owne and his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, or that which belongs to others: in the firſt, hee ought to be ſparing, in the ſecond hee ſhould not omit any part of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality. And that Prince, that goes abroad wtth his army, and feeds upon prey, and ſpoyle, and tributes, and hath the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of that which belongs to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, neceſſarily ſhould uſe this liberality; otherwiſe would his ſouldiers never follow him; and of that which is neither thine,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:12126:70"/> nor thy ſubjects, thou mayeſt well be a free giver, as were <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, Caeſar,</hi> and <hi>Alexander;</hi> for the ſpending of that which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers, takes not away thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, but rather addes to it, only the waſting of that which is thine owne, hurts thee; nor is there any thing conſumes it ſelfe ſo much as liberality, which whilſt thou uſeſt, thou loſeſt the meanes to make uſe of it, and becom'ſt poore and abject, or to avoyd this poverty an extorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner and hatefull perſon. And among all thoſe things which a Prince ought to beware of, is, to bee diſpiſd, and odious; to one and the other of which, liberality brings thee. Wherefore there is more diſcretion to hold the ſtile of Miſerable, which begets an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy without hatred, than to deſire that of Liberall, whereby to incurre the neceſſity of being thought an extortioner, which procures an infamy with hatred.</p>

               <p>DEſcending afterwards unto the other fore-alleadged qualities, I ſay, that every Prince ſhould deſire to be held pittifull, and not cruell. Nevertheleſſe ought hee beware that he ill uſes not this pitty. <hi>Caeſar Borgia</hi> was accounted cruell, yet had his cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty redreſt the diſorders in <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mania,</hi> ſettled it in union, and reſtord it to peace, and fidelity: which, if it be well weighd, we ſhall ſee was an act of more pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than that of the people of <hi>Florence,</hi> who to avoyd the terme of cruelty, ſufferd <hi>Piſtoya</hi> to fall to deſtruction. Wherefore a Prince ought not to regard the infamy of cruelty, for to hold his ſubjects united and faithfull: for by giving a very few proofes of himſelfe the other way, hee
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:12126:71"/> ſhall be held more pittifull than they, who through their too much pitty, ſuffer diſorders to follow, from whence ariſe mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and rapines: for theſe are wont to hurt an intire univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality, whereas the executions practiſd by a Prince, hurt only ſome particular. And among all ſorts of Princes, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a new Prince to avoyd the name of cruell, becauſe all new States are full of dangers: Whereupon <hi>Virgil</hi> by the mouth of <hi>Dido</hi> excuſes the inhumanity of her Kingdome, ſaying,

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:12126:72"/> a moderate way with wiſdome, and humanity, that his too much confidence make him not unwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and his too much diſtruſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable, From hence ariſes a diſpute, whether it is better to be belov'd or feard: I anſwer, a man would wiſh hee might bee the one and the other: but becauſe hardly can they ſubſiſt both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it is much ſafer to be feard, than be lov'd; being that one of the two muſt needs faile; for touching men, wee may ſay this in generall, they are unthankfull, unconſtant, diſſemblers, they avoyd dangers, and are covetous of gaine; and whilſt thou doeſt them good, they are wholly thine their blood, their fortunes, lives and children are at thy ſervice, as is ſaid before, when the danger is remote; but when it approaches, they revolt. And that Prince; who wholly relyes upon their words, unfurniſhd of all other preparations, goes to wrack: for the friendſhips that are gotten
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:12126:72"/> with rewards, and not by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificence and worth of the mind, are dearely bought indeed; but they will neither keep long, nor ſerve well in time of need: and men doe leſſe regard to offend one that is ſupported by love, than by feare. For love is held by a certainty of obligation, which, becauſe men are miſchei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, is broken upon any occaſion of their owne profit. But feare reſtrains with a dread of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which never forſaks a man. Yet ought a Prince cause him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be belovd in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that if hee gaines not love, he may avoyd hatred: for it may well ſtand together, that a man may bee feard and not hated; which ſhall never faile, if hee abſtaine from his ſubjects goods, and their wives; and whenſoever hee ſhould be forc'd to proceed againſt any of their lives, doe it when it is to be done upon a juſt cauſe, and apparent conviction; but above all things forbeare to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:12126:73"/> lay his hands on other mens goods; for men forget ſooner the death of their father, than the loſſe of their patrimony. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the occaſions of taking from men their goods, do never faile: and alwayes hee that begins to live by rapine, finds occaſion to lay hold upon other mens goods: but againſt mens lives they are ſeldomer found, and ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner faile. But when a Prince is abroad in the feild with his army and hath a multitude of ſouldiers under his government, then is it neceſſary that he ſtands not much upon it, though hee be termd cruell: for unleſſe hee be ſo, hee ſhall never have his ſouldiers live in accord one with another, nor ever well diſpoſd to any brave peece of ſervice. Among <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibals</hi> actions of mervaile this is reckond for one, that having a very huge army, gatherd out of ſeverall nations, and all led to ſerve in a ſtrange countrey, there was never any diſſention neither
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:12126:73"/> amongſt themſelves, nor againſt their Generall, as well in their bad fortune as their good. Which could not proceed from any thing elſe, than from that bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous cruelty of his, which, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his exceeding many vertues, renderd him to his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers both venerable and terrible; without which, to that effect his other vertues had ſervd him to little purpoſe: and ſome writers, though not of the beſt adviſed, on one ſide admire theſe his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy actions, and on the other ſide, condemne the principall cauſes thereof. And that it is true, that his other vertues would not have ſuffis'd him, wee may conſider in <hi>Scipio,</hi> the rareſt man not only in the dayes he liv'd, but even in the memory of man; from whom his army rebell'd in <hi>Spain:</hi> which grew only upon his too much cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, which had given way to his ſouldiers to become more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious, that was well tolerable by military diſcipline: for which
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:12126:74"/> hee was reprov'd by <hi>Fabius Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximus</hi> in the Senate, who termd him the corrupter of the <hi>Romane</hi> ſouldiery. The <hi>Locrenſians</hi> having been deſtroyed by a Lieftenant of <hi>Scipio's,</hi> were never reveng'd by him, nor the inſolence of that Lieftenant puniſht, all this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from his eaſie nature: ſo that one deſiring to excuſe him in the Senate, ſaid, that there were many men knew better how to keep themſelves from faults, than to correct the faults of other men: which diſpoſition of his in time would have wrong'd <hi>Scipio's</hi> reputation &amp; glory, had he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with continu'd in his commands: but living under the government of the Senate, this quality of his that would have diſgrac'd him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not only was conceal'd, but prov'd to the advancement of his glory. I conclude then, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the purpoſe of being feard, and belov'd; inſomuch as men love at their owne pleaſure and to ſerve their owne turne, and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:12126:74"/> their feare depends upon the Princes pleaſure, every wiſe Prince ought to ground upon that which is of himſelfe, and not upon that which is of another: only this, he ought to uſe his beſt wits to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void hatred, as was ſaid.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP, XVIII.</hi> In what manner Princes ought to keep their words.</head>
               <p>HOw commendable in a Prince it is to keepe his word, and live with integrity, not making uſe of cunning and ſubtlety, every one knows well: yet wee ſee by experience in theſe our dayes, that thoſe Princes have effected great matters, who have made ſmall reckoning of keeping their words, and have known by their craft to turne and wind men about, and in the end have overcome thoſe who have groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the truth. You muſt then know, there are two kinds of combating or fighting; the one
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:12126:75"/> by right of the laws, the other meerly by force. That firſt way is proper to men, the other is alſo common to beaſts: but becauſe the firſt many times ſuffices not, there is a neceſſity to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the ſecond; wherefore it behooves a Prince to know how to make good uſe of that part which belongs to a beaſt, as well as that which is proper to a man. This part hath been covertly ſhew'd to Princes by ancient writers; who ſay that <hi>Achilles</hi> and many others of thoſe ancient Princes were intruſted to <hi>Chiron</hi> the Centaure, to bee brought up under his diſcipline: the morall of this, having for their teacher one that was halfe a beaſt and halfe a man, was nothing elſe, but that it was needfull for a Prince, to underſtand how to make his advantage of the one and the other nature, becauſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could ſubſiſt without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. A Prince then being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to know how to make
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:12126:75"/> uſe of that part belonging to a beaſt, ought to ſerve himſelfe of the conditions of the Foxe and the Lion; for the Lion cannot keep himſelf from ſnares, nor the Foxe defend himſelfe againſt the Wolves. Hee had need then bee a Foxe, that hee may beware of the ſnares, and a Lion, that he may ſcarre the Wolves. Thoſe that ſtand wholly upon the Lion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not well themſelves. And therefore a wiſe Prince can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, nor ought not keep his faith given, when the obſervance ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of turnes to diſadvantage, and the occaſions that made him promiſe, are paſt. For if men were all good, this rule would not be allowable; but being they are full of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, and would not make it good to thee, neither art thou tyed to keep it with them: nor ſhall a Prince ever want lawfull occaſions to give colour to this breach. Very many moderne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples hereof might be alleadg'd, wherin might be ſhewd how many
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:12126:76"/> peaces concluded, and how many promiſes made, have bin viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and broken by the infidelity of Princes; and ordinarily things have beſt ſucceeded with him that hath been neereſt the Foxe in condition. But it is neceſſary to underſtand how to ſet a good co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour upon this diſpoſition, and to bee able to faine and diſſemble throughly; and men are ſo ſimple and yeeld ſo much to the preſent neceſſities, that hee who hath a mind to deceive, ſhall alwayes find another that will be deceivd. I will not conceale any one of the examples that have been of late. <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixth, never did any thing elſe than deceive men, and never meant otherwiſe, and alwayes found whome to worke upon; yet never was there man would proteſt more effectually, nor averre any thing with more ſolemne oaths, and obſerve them leſſe than he; nevertheleſſe, his cooſenages all thriv'd well with him; for hee knew how to play
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:12126:76"/> this part cunningly. Therefore is there no neceſſity for a Prince to bee endued with all theſe above written qualities, but it behooves well that he ſeeme to be ſo; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I will boldly ſay this, that having theſe qualities, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways regulating himſelfe by them, they are hurtfull, but ſeeming to have them, they are advantagious; as to ſeeme piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, faithfull, mild, religious, and of integrity, and indeed to be ſo; provided withall thou beeſt of ſuch a compoſition, that if need require thee to uſe the contrary, thou canſt, and know'ſt how to apply thy ſelfe thereto. And it ſuffices to conceive this, that a Prince, and eſpecially a new Prince, cannot obſerve all thoſe things, for which men are held good; he being often forc'd, for the maintenance of his State, to do contrary to his faith, charity, humanity, and religion: and therefore it behooves him to have a mind ſo diſposd as to turne and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:12126:77"/> take the advantage of all winds and fortunes; and as formerly I ſaid, not forſake the good; while he can; but to know how to make uſe of the evill upon neceſſity. A Prince then ought to have a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall care, that he never let fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny words, but what are all ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd with the five above-written qualities, and let him ſeem to him that ſees and heares him, all pitty, all faith, all integrity, all huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, all religion; nor is there any thing more neceſſary for him to ſeeme to have, than this laſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: for all men in generall judge thereof, rather by the ſight than by the touch; for every man may come to the ſight of him, few come to the touch and feeling of him; every man may come to ſee what thou ſeemeſt, few come to perceive and underſtand what thou art; and thoſe few dare not oppoſe the opinion of many, who have the majeſty of State to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them: And in all mens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, eſpecially thoſe of Princes,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:12126:77"/> wherein there is no judgement to appeale unto, men forbeare to give their cenſures till the events, and ends of things. Let a Prince therefore take the ſureſt courſes he can to maintaine his life and State: the meanes ſhall alwaies be thought honorable, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by every one: for the vulgar is over-taken with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance and event of a thing: and for the moſt part of people, they are but the vulgar: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are but few, take place where the vulgar have no ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence. A Prince there is in theſe dayes, whom I ſhall not do well to name, that preaches nothing elſe but peace and faith; but had he keept the one and the other, ſeverall times had they ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him his State and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>

                     <hi>In the ſixteenth, ſeaventeenth, and eighteenth Chap. our Author deſcends to particulars, perſwading his Prince in his ſixteenth to ſuch
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:12126:78"/> a ſupleneſſe of dispoſition, as that upon occaſion hee can make uſe either of liberality or miſerable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe as need ſhall require. But that of liberality is to laſt no longer, than while hee is in the way to ſome deſigne: which if we well weigh, is not really a reward of vertue, how ere it ſeemes; but a bait and lure to bring birds to the net. In the ſeventeenth Chap. hee treats of clemency and cruelty; neither of which are to be exercisd by him as acts of mercy or juſtice; but as they may ſerve to advantage his further purpoſes. And lest the Prince ſhould incline too much to clemency, our Author allowes rather the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint by feare, than by love. The contrary to which all ſtories ſhew us. I will ſay this only, cruelty may cut of the power of ſome, but cauſes the hatred of all, and gives a will to moſt to take the firſt occaſion offered for revenge. In the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Chap. our Author diſcourſes how Princes ought to governe themſelves in keeping their promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:12126:78"/> made: whereof hee ſayes they ought to make ſuch ſmall reckoning as that rather they ſhould know by their craft how to turne and wind men about, whereby to take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of all winds and fortunes. To this J would oppoſe that in the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Pſal. v.</hi> 5. <hi>Hee that ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to his neighbour, and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth him not, though it were to his owne hindrance. It was a King that writ it: and mee thinks the rule hee gave, ſhould well befit both King and ſubject: and ſurely this perſwades againſt all taking of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages. A man may reduce all the cauſes of faith-breaking to three heads. One may be, becauſe he that promiſd, had no intention to keep his word; and this is a wicked and malitious way of dealing. A ſecond may bee, becauſe hee that promiſd, repents of his promiſe made; and that is grounded on un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy, and lightneſſe in that hee would not bee well reſolved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be entred into covenant. The third may bee, when it ſo falls out,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:12126:79"/> that it lyes not in his power, that made the promiſe to performe it. In which caſe a man ought to imitate the good debter, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not wherewithall to pay, hides not himſelfe, but preſents his perſon to his creditour; willingly ſuffering impriſonment. The firſt and ſecond are very vitious and unworthy of a Prince: in the third, men might well bee directed by the examples of thoſe two famous Romans,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulus <hi>and</hi> Poſthumius. <hi>I ſhall cloſe this with that anſwer of</hi> Charles <hi>the fifth when hee was preſſd to break his word with</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>for his ſafe returne from</hi> Wormes.

                  <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> That Princes ſhould take a care, not to incurre contempt or hatred.</head>
               <p>BUt becauſe among the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, wherof formerly mention is made, I have ſpoken of thoſe of moſt importance; I will treat of the others more briefly under theſe qualities, that a Prince is to beware, as in part is above ſaid, and that he fly thoſe things which cauſe him to bee odious or vile: and when ever hee ſhall avoid this, he ſhall fully have playd his part, and in the other diſgraces he ſhall find no danger at all. There is nothing makes him ſo odious, as I ſaid, as his extortion of his ſubjects goods, and abuſe of their women, from which hee ought to forbeare: and ſo long as hee wrongs not his whole people neither in their goods, nor ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, they live content, and hee hath only to ſtrive with the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of ſome few: which many
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:12126:80"/> wayes, &amp; eaſily too, is reſtrain'd. To be held various, light, effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, faint-harted, unreſolv'd, theſe make him be contemnd and thought baſe, which a Prince ſhould ſhun like rocks, and take a care that in all his actions there appeare magnanimity, courage, gravity, and valour; and that in all the private affaires of his ſubjects, he orders it ſo, that his word ſtand irrevocable: and maintaines himſelfe in ſuch repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, that no man may think nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to deceive, nor wind and turn him about; that Prince that gives ſuch an opinion of himſelf, is much eſteemd: and againſt him, who is ſo well eſteemd, hardly are any conſpiracies made by his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, or by forreiners any invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when once notice is taken of his worth, and how much hee is reverenced by his ſubjects. For a Prince ought to have two feares, the one from within, in regard of his ſubjects; the other from abroad, in regard of his
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:12126:80"/> mighty neighbours; from theſe he defends himſelfe by good armes and good friends, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes he ſhall have good friends if he have good armes; and all things ſhall always ſtand ſure at home, when thoſe abroad are firme; in caſe ſome conſpiracy have not diſturb'd them, and however the forraine matters ſtand but tickliſhly; yet if hee have taken ſuch courſes at home, and liv'd as we have preſcrib'd, he ſhall ever be able (in caſe he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake not himſelfe) to reſiſt all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible force and violence, as I ſaid, <hi>Nabis</hi> the Spartan did: but tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his ſubjects, even when his affaires abroad are ſetled, it is to be fear'd, they may conſpire pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily; from which a Prince ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſecures himſelfe by ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to bee hated or contemnd, and keeping himſelf in his peoples good opinion, which it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for him to compaſſe, as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we treated at large. And one of the powerfulleſt remedies a
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:12126:81"/> Prince can have againſt conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies, is, not to bee hated nor deſpiſd by the univerſality; for alwaies he that conſpires, beleevs the Princes death is acceptable to the ſubject: but when he thinks it diſpleaſes them, he hath not the heart to venture on ſuch a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for the difficulties that are on the conſpirators ſide, are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite. By experience it is plaine, that many times plots have been laid, but few of them have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded luckily; for hee that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires, cannot be alone, nor can he take the company of any but of thoſe, who, he beleevs are male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents; and ſo ſoon as thou haſt diſcover'd thy ſelf to a malecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, thou giv'ſt him meanes to work his own content: for by revealing thy treaſon, hee may well hope for all manner of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: ſo that ſeing his gaine cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of one ſide; and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, finding only doubt and danger, either hee had need be a rare friend, or that he be an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:12126:81"/> obſtinate enemy to the Prince, if he keeps his word with thee. And to reduce this matter into ſhort termes: I ſay, there is nothing but jealouſie, feare, and ſuſpect of puniſhment on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators part to affright him; but on the Princes part, there is the majeſty of the principality, the lawes, the defences of his friends and the State, which do ſo guard him; that to all theſe things the peoples goods wills be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing added, it is unpoſſible, any one ſhould be ſo head-ſtrong, as to conſpire; for ordinarily where a traytor is to feare before the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of his miſchiefe; in this caſe he is alſo to feare afterwards, having the people for his enemy, when the fact is committed; and therefore for this cauſe, not being able to hope for any refuge. Touching this matter, many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples might be brought, but I will content my ſelfe to name one which fell out in the memory of our Fathers. <hi>Annibal Bentivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lii,</hi>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:12126:82"/> grand-father of this <hi>Anniball</hi> who now lives, that was Prince in <hi>Bolonia,</hi> being ſlaine by the <hi>Canneſchi,</hi> that conſpir'd againſt him, none of his race being left, but this <hi>John,</hi> who was then in ſwadling clouts; preſenty the people roſe, upon this murder, and ſlew all the <hi>Canneſch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>;</hi> which proceeded from the popular affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which the family of the <hi>Bentivolii</hi> held then in <hi>Bolonia:</hi> which was ſo great, that being there remain'd not any, now <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niball</hi> was dead, that was able to manage the State; and having notice that in <hi>Florence</hi> there was one borne of the <hi>Bentivolii,</hi> who till then was taken for a Smiths ſonne: the citizens of <hi>Bolonia</hi> went to <hi>Florence</hi> for him, and gave the government of their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to him, which was rul'd by him, untill <hi>John</hi> was of fit yeares to governe. I conclude then that a Prince ought to make ſmal account of treaſons, whiles he hath the people to friend: but if
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:12126:82"/> they be his enemies and hate him, he may well feare every thing, and every one. And well orderd States, and diſcreet Princes have taken care withall diligence, not to cauſe their great men to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deſperation, and to content the the people, and ſo to maintaine them: for this is one of the moſt important buſineſſes belonging to a Prince. Among the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes that are well orderd and governd in our dayes, is that of <hi>France,</hi> and therein are found ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding many good orders; whereupon the Kings liberty and ſecurity depends: of which the chiefe is the Parliament, and the authority thereof: for hee that founded that Kingdome, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great mens ambition and inſolence; and judgeing it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry there ſhould bee a bridle to curbe them; and on the other ſide knowing the hatred of the Commonalty againſt the great ones, grounded upon feare, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to ſecure them, would
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:12126:83"/> not lay this care wholly upon the King; but take this trouble from him, which hee might have with the great men, in caſe hee favourd the Commonalty, or with the Commonalty in caſe hee favourd the great men: and thereupon ſet up a third judge, which was that, to the end it ſhould keep under the great ones, and favour the meaner ſort, without any imputation to the King. It was not poſſible to take a better, nor wiſer courſe than this, nor a ſurer way to ſecure the King, and the Kingdome. From whence we may drawe another concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on worthie of note, that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ought to cauſe others to take upon them the matters of blame and imputation; and upon themſelves to take only thoſe of grace and favour. Here againe I conclude, that a Prince ought to make good eſteeme of his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; but not thereby to incurre the Commons hatred: It would
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:12126:83"/> ſeem perhaps to many, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the life and death of many <hi>Romane</hi> Emperours, that they were examples contrary to my opinion, finding that ſome have liv'd worthily, and ſhewd many rare vertues of the minde, and yet have loſt the Empire, and been put to death by their owne ſubjects, conſpiring againſt them. Intending then to anſwer theſe objections; I ſhall diſcourſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the qualities of ſome Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, declaring the occaſions of their ruine, not diſagreeing from that which I have alleagd: and part thereof I will beſtow on the conſideration of theſe things; which are worthy to be noted by him that reads the actions of thoſe times: and it ſhall ſuffice mee to take all thoſe Emperours, that ſucceeded in the Empire from <hi>Marcus</hi> the Philoſopher to <hi>Maximinus,</hi> who were <hi>Marcus</hi> and <hi>Commodus</hi> his ſonne, <hi>Perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nax, Julian, Severus, Antonius, Caracalla</hi> his ſonne, <hi>Macrinus,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:12126:84"/> Heliogabalus, Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Maximin.</hi> And firſt it is to be noted, that were in the other Principalities, they are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend only with the ambition of the Nobles, and the inſolence of the people; the Romane Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours had a third difficulty, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to ſupport the cruelty and covetouſneſſe of the ſouldiers, which was ſo hard a thing, that it cauſd the ruine of many, being hard to ſatisfy the ſouldiers, and the people: for the people love their quiet, and therefore affect modeſt Princes; and the ſouldiers love a Prince of a warlike cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, that is inſolent, cruell and plucking from every one: which things they would have them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe upon the people, whereby they might bee able to double their ſtipends, and ſatisfie their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice and cruelty: whence it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, that thoſe Emperours who either by Nature or by Art had not ſuch a reputation, as therewith they could curbe the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:12126:84"/> one and the other, were alwayes ruind: and the moſt of them, ſpecially thoſe, who as new men came to the principality, finding the difficulty of thoſe two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent humours, applyd themſelves to content the ſouldiers, making ſmall account of wronging the people: which was a courſe then neceſſary; for the Princes not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to eſcape the hatred of every one, ought firſt endeavour that they incurre not the hatred of any whole univerſality; and when they cannot attaine ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, they are to provide with all induſtry, to avoyd the hatred of thoſe univerſalities, that are the moſt mighty. And therefore thoſe Emperours, who becauſe they were but newly call'd to the Empire, had need of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary favours, more willing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y ſtuck to the ſouldiers, than to the people; which nevertheleſſe turnd to their advantage, or otherwiſe, according as that Prince knew how to maintaine his repute with
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:12126:85"/> them. From theſe cauſes afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd proceeded it, that <hi>Marcus, Pertinax,</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> though all living modeſtly, being lovers of juſtice, and enemies of cruelty, courteous, and bountifull, had all from <hi>Marcus</hi> onward, miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ends; <hi>Marcus</hi> only liv'd and dy'd exceedingly honoured: for hee came to the Empire by inheritance, and was not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it neither from the ſouldiers, nor from the people: afterwards being accompanyed with many vertues, which made him venerable, hee held alwayes whilſt he liv'd, the one and the other order within their limits, and was never either hated, or contemnd. But <hi>Pertinax</hi> was created Emperour againſt the ſouldiers wills, who being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomd to live licentiouſly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Commodus,</hi> could not endure that honeſt courſe, that <hi>Perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nax</hi> ſought to reduce them to: Whereupon having gotten him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hatred, and to this hatred ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:12126:85"/> contempt, in that hee was old, was ruind in the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his government. Whence it ought to be obſerved, that hatred is gaind as well by good deeds as bad; and therefore as I formerly ſaid, when a Prince would maintaine the State, hee is often forcd not to be good: for when that generalty, whether it be the people, or ſouldiers, or Nobility, whereof thou thinkſt thou ſtandſt in need to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thee, is corrupted, it behooves th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e to follow their humour, and content them, and then all good deeds are thy adverſaries. But let us come to <hi>Alexander,</hi> who was of that goodneſſe, that among the prayſes given him, had this for one, that in fourteen yeers wherein he held the Empire, he never put any man to death but by courſe of juſtice; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eleſſe being held effeminate, and a man that ſuffered himſelfe to be ruld by his mother, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon fallen into contempt;
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:12126:86"/> the army conſpird againſt him. Now on the contrary diſcourſing upon the qualities of <hi>Commodus, Severus, Antonius, Caracalla,</hi> and <hi>Maximinus,</hi> you ſhall find them exceeding cruell, and ravinous, who to ſatisfie their ſouldiers, forbeare no kinde of injury, that could be done upon the people; and all of them, except <hi>Severus,</hi> came to evill ends: for in <hi>Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> there was ſuch extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry valour, that while hee held the ſouldiers his friends, however the people were much burthend by him, he might alwayes reigne happily: for his valour rendred him ſo admirable in the ſouldiers and peoples ſights; that theſe in a manner ſtood amazd and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhd, and thoſe others reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencing, and honoring him. And becauſe the actions of this man were exceeding great being in a new Prince, I will briefly ſhew, how well hee knew to act the Foxes and the Lions parts; the conditions of which two, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſay, as
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:12126:86"/> before, are very neceſſary for a Prince to imitate. <hi>Severus</hi> having had experience of <hi>Iulian</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours ſloth, perſwaded his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my (whereof hee was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in <hi>Sclavonia</hi>) that they ſhould doe well to goe to <hi>Rome,</hi> to revenge <hi>Pertinax</hi> his death, who was put to death by the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall guard; and under this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, not making any ſhew that hee aſpird unto the Empire, ſet his army in march directly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Rome,</hi> and was ſooner come into <hi>Italy,</hi> than it was knowne hee had mov'd from his ſtation. Being arriv'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> hee was by the Senate choſen Emperour for feare; and <hi>Julian</hi> ſlaine. After this beginning, two difficulties yet remaind to <hi>Severus,</hi> before hee could make himſelfe Lord of the whole State; the one in <hi>Aſia,</hi> where <hi>Niger</hi> the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of thoſe armies had gotten the title of Emperour, the other in the Weſt with <hi>Albinus,</hi> who alſo aſpird to the Empire: and

                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:12126:88"/> becauſe hee thought there might be ſome danger to diſcover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe enemy to them both; he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſd to ſet upon <hi>Niger,</hi> and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen <hi>Albinus,</hi> to whom hee writ, that being elected Emperour by the Senate, hee would willingly communicate it with him; and thereupon ſent him the title of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and by reſolution of the Senate, tooke him to him for his Collegue; which things were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by <hi>Albinus</hi> in true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But afterwards when <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus</hi> had overcome and ſlaine <hi>Niger,</hi> and pacified the affaires in the Eaſt, being returnd to <hi>Rome,</hi> hee complaind in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of <hi>Albinus,</hi> how little weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the benefits received from him, hee had ſought to ſlay him by treaſon, and therefore was hee forc'd to goe puniſh his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude: afterwards hee went into <hi>France,</hi> where hee bereft him, both of his State, and life. Whoever then ſhall in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar examine his actions, ſhall
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:12126:88"/> finde hee was a very cruell Lion, and as crafty a Foxe: and ſhall ſee that hee was alwayes feard and reverenc'd by every one, and by the armies not hated; and ſhall nothing marvell that hee being a new man, was able to hold t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>gether ſuch a great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: for his extraordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation defended him alwayes from that hatred, which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for his extortions might have conceiv'd againſt him. But <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius</hi> his ſonne, was alſo an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding brave man, and endued with moſt excellent qualities, which cauſd him to be admird by the people, and acceptable to the ſouldiers; becauſe hee was a warrlike man, enduring all kind of travell and paines, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing all delicate food, and all kinde of effeminacy; which gaind him the love of all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: nevertheleſſe his fierceneſſe and cruelty were ſuch and ſo hideous, having upon many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular occaſions put to death a

Where it is to be noted, that theſe kinde of deaths, which follow upon the deliberation of a reſolv'd and obſtinate minde, cannot by a Prince be avoyded: for every one that feares not to dye, is able to doe it; but a Prince ought to be leſſe afraid of it; becauſe it very ſeldome falls out.

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:12126:89"/> and the way to deſtruction, as befell him. But let us come to <hi>Commodus,</hi> for whom it was very eaſie to hold the Empire, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it deſcended upon him by inheritance, being <hi>Marcus</hi> his ſonn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>; and it had been enough for him to follow his fathers foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps, and then had hee conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both the people and the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: but being of a cruell and ſavage diſpoſition, whereby to excerciſe his actions upon the people, hee gave himſelfe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine armies, and thoſe in all licentiouſneſſe. On the other part not maintaining his digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but often deſcending upon the ſtages to combate with fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and doing ſuch other like baſe things, little worthy of the Imperiall majeſty, hee became contemptible in the ſouldiers ſight, and being hated of one part, and diſpiſd of the other, he was conſpird againſt, and ſlaine. It remaines now that wee declare <hi>Maximinus</hi> his conditions: who
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:12126:90"/> was a very warrlike man; and the armies loathing <hi>Alexanders</hi> effeminacy, whereof I ſpake before, when they had ſlain him, choſe this man Emperour; who not long continu'd ſo, becauſe two things there were that brought him into hatred and contempt; the one becauſe hee was very baſe, having kept cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell in <hi>Thrace,</hi> which was well knowne to every one, and made them to ſcorne him; the other, becauſe in the beginning of his Principality having delayd to goe to <hi>Rome,</hi> and enter into poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Imperiall throne, he had gaind the infamy of being thought exceding cruell, having by his Prefects in <hi>Rome,</hi> and in every place of the Empire exerciſd many cruelties, inſomuch that the whole world being provok'd againſt him to contempt for the baſeneſſe of his blood, on the other ſide upon the hatred con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd againſt him for feare of his cruelty; firſt <hi>Affrica,</hi> afterwards
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:12126:90"/> the <hi>Senate</hi> with all the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all <hi>Italy</hi> conſpird againſt him, with whom his own army took part; which incamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before <hi>Aquileya,</hi> and finding ſome difficulty to take the town, being weary of his cruelties, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſaw he had ſo many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, fearing him the leſſe, ſlew him. I purpoſe not to ſay any thing either of <hi>Heliogabalus, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crinus,</hi> or <hi>Julian,</hi> who becauſe they were throughly baſe, were ſuudenly extinguiſhd; but I will come to the concluſion of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; and I ſay, that the Princes of our times have leſſe of this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to ſatisfie the Souldiers extraordinarily in their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for notwithſtanding that there be ſome conſideration to bee had of them; yet preſently are thoſe armies diſſolv'd, becauſe none of theſe Princes do uſe to maintaine any armies together, which are annex'd and invetera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the governments of the provinces, as were the armies of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:12126:91"/> the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if then it was neceſſary ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to content the ſouldiers than the people, it was becauſe the ſouldiers were more powerfull than the people: now is it more neceſſary for all Princes, (except the <hi>Turk</hi> and the <hi>Souldan</hi>) to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their people than their ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: becauſe the people are more mighty than they; wherein I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the <hi>Turk,</hi> he alwayes main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining about his perſon 12000 foot, and 15000 horſe, upon which depends the ſafety and ſtrength of his Kingdome, and it is neceſſary that laying aſide all other regard of his people, hee maintaine theſe his friends. The <hi>Souldans</hi> Kingdome is like here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, which being wholly in the ſouldiers power, hee muſt alſo without reſpect of his people keep them his friends. And you are to conſider, that this State of the <hi>Souldans</hi> differs much from all the other Principalities: for it is very like the Papacy, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:12126:91"/> be termd a hereditary Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality, nor a new Principality: for the ſonns of the deceaſd Prince are not heires and Lords thereof; but hee that is choſen, receives that dignity from thoſe, who have the authority in them. And this order being of antiquity, cannot be termd a new Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, becauſe therein are none of thoſe difficulties, that are in the new ones: for though the Prince be new; yet are the orders of that State ancient, and ordaind to receive him, as if hee were their hereditary Prince. But let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to our matter; whoſoever ſhall conſider our diſcourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſhall perceive that either hatred, or contempt have cauſd the ruine of the afore-namd Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours; and ſhall know alſo, from it came that part of them proceeding one way, and part a contrary; yet in any of them the one had a happy ſucceſſe, and the others unhappy: for it was of no availe, but rather hurtfull, for
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:12126:92"/> 
                  <hi>Pertinax</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were new Princes, to deſire to imitate <hi>Marcus,</hi> who by inheritance came to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality: and in like manner it was a wrong to <hi>Caracalla, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus,</hi> and <hi>Maximinus</hi> to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itate <hi>Severus,</hi> becauſe none of them were endued with ſo great valour as to follow his ſtepps therein. Wherefore a new Prince in his Principality cannot well imitate <hi>Marcus</hi> his actions; nor yet is it neceſſary to follow thoſe of <hi>Severus:</hi> but he ought make choyce of thoſe parts in <hi>Severus</hi> which are neceſſary for the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of a State; and to take from <hi>Marcus</hi> thoſe that are fitt and glorious to preſerve a State which is already eſtabliſhd and ſetled.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XX.</hi> Whether the Citadels and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, which Princes often make uſe of, are profitable or dammageable.</head>
               <p>SOme Princes, whereby they might ſafely keep their State, have diſarmd their ſubjects; ſome others have held the townes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their dominion, devided into factions; others have maintain'd enmities againſt themſelves; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have apply'd themſelves to gaine them, where they have ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected at their entrance into the government; others have built Fortreſſes; and others again have ruind and demoliſhd them: and however that upon all theſe things, a man cannot well paſſe a determinate ſentence, unleſſe one comes to the particulars of theſe States, where ſome ſuch like deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations were to be taken; yet ſhall I ſpeake of them in ſo large a manner, as the matter of it ſelfe
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:12126:93"/> will beare. It was never then that a new Prince would diſarme his own ſubjects; but rather when hee hath found them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armd, hee hath alwayes armd them. For being belov'd, thoſe armes become thine; thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come faithfull, which thou hadſt in ſuſpicion; and thoſe which were faithfull, are maitaind ſo; and thy ſubjects are made thy partiſans: and becauſe all thy ſubjects cannot be put in armes, when thou beſtowſt favours on thoſe thou armeſt, with the others thou canſt deale more for thy ſafety; and that difference of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding which they know among them, obliges them to thee; thoſe others excuſe thee, judgeing it neceſſary, that they have deſervd more, who have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergon more danger, and ſo have greater obligation: but when thou diſarmſt them, thou beginſt to offend them, that thou di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſts them, either for cowardiſe, or ſmall faith; and the one or the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:12126:93"/> other of thoſe two opinions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes their hatred againſt thee: and becauſe thou canſt not ſtand diſarmd, thou muſt then turne thy ſelfe to mercenary Souldiery, whereof wee have formerly ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken what it is: and when it is good, it can never bee ſo much as to defend thee from powerfull enemies, and ſuſpected ſubjects; therefore as I have ſaid, a new Prince in a new Principality hath always ordaind them armes. Of examples to this purpoſe, Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories are full. But when a Prince gaines a new State, which as a member hee addes to his ancient dominions; then it is neceſſary to diſarme that State, unleſſe it be thoſe whom thou haſt diſcoverd to have aſſiſted thee in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt thereof; and theſe alſo in time and upon occaſions, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to render delicate and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate, and ſo order them, that all the armes of thy State be in the hands of thy own Souldiers, who live in thy ancient State
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:12126:94"/> neare unto thee. Our anceſtors and they that were accounted ſages, were wont to ſay, that it was neceſſary to hold <hi>Piſtoya</hi> in factions, and <hi>Piſa</hi> with Fortreſſes; and for this cauſe maintaind ſome towne ſubject to them in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, whereby to hold it more eaſily. This, at what time <hi>Italy</hi> was ballanc'd in a certaine man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, might be well done; but me thinks it cannot now adayes bee well given for a precept; for I do not beleeve, that diviſions made can do any good; rather it muſt needs bee, that when the enemy approaches them, Cities divided are preſently loſt; for alwayes the weaker part will cleave to the forreine power, and the other not be able to ſubſiſt. The <hi>Venetians</hi> (as I think) mov'd by the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid reaſons, maintaind the facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Guelfes</hi> and <hi>Gibellius,</hi> in their townes; and however they never ſuffer'd them to ſpill one anothers blood, yet they nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhd theſe differences among
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:12126:94"/> them, to the end that the citizens imployd in theſe quarrels, ſhould not plot any thing againſt them: which as it prov'd, never ſerv'd them to any great purpoſe: for being defeated at <hi>Vayla,</hi> preſently one of thoſe two factions tooke courage and ſeizd upon their whole State. Therefore ſuch like wayes argue the Princes weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; for in a ſtrong principality they never will ſuffer ſuch diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for they ſhew them ſome kind of profit in time of peace, being they are able by meanes thereof more eaſily to manage their ſubjects; but war comming, ſuch like orders diſcover their fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy. Without doubt, Princes become great, when they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the difficulties and oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are made againſt them; and therefore Fortune eſpecially when ſhe hath to make any new Prince great, who hath more need to gaine reputation, than a here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Prince, cauſes enemies to riſe againſt him, and him to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:12126:95"/> againſt them; to the end he may have occaſion to maſter them, and know that ladder, which his enemies have ſet him upon, whereby to riſe yet higher. And therefore many think, that a wiſe Prince, when hee hath the occaſion, ought cunningly to nouriſh ſome enmity, that by the ſuppreſſing thereof, his greatneſſe may grow thereupon. Princes, eſpecially thoſe that are new, have found more faith and profit in thoſe men, who in the beginning of their State, have been held ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, than in thoſe who at their entrance have been their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. <hi>Pandulphus Petrucei,</hi> Prince of <hi>Siena,</hi> governd his State more with them that had bin ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by him, than with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But of this matter we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpeak at large, becauſe it va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries according to the ſubject; I will only ſay this, that thoſe men, who in the beginning of a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality were once enemies, if they be of quality, ſo that to maintain
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:12126:95"/> themſelves they have need of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, the Prince might alwayes with the greateſt facility gaine for his; and they are the rather forc'd to ſerve him faithfully, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as they know it is more neceſſary for them by their deeds to cancell that ſiniſter opinion, which was once held of them; and ſo the Prince ever draws from theſe more advantage, than from thoſe, who ſerving him too ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinely, neglect his affaires. And ſeing the matter requires it, I will not omit, to put a Prince in mind, who hath anew made himſelfe maſter of a State, by meanes of the inward helpes he had from thence, that he conſider well, the cauſe that mov'd them that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd him to favour him, if it be not a naturall affection towards him; for if it be only becauſe they were not content with their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer government, with much paines and difficulties ſhall he be able to keep them long his friends, becauſe it will bee impoſſible for
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:12126:96"/> him to content them. By theſe examples then, which are drawn out of ancient and moderne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, ſearching into the cauſe hereof, wee ſhall find it much more eaſie to gaine thoſe men for friends, who formerly were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the State, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were his enemies: than thoſe, who becauſe they were not contented therewith, became his friends, and favourd him in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the maſtery of it. It hath been the cuſtome of Princes, wherby to hold their States more ſecurely, to build Citadels, which might bee bridles and curbs to thoſe that ſhould purpoſe any thing againſt them, and ſo to have a ſecure retraite from the firſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olences. I commend this courſe, becauſe it hath been uſd of old; notwithſtanding <hi>Nicolas Vitelli</hi> in our dayes hath been knowne to demoliſh two Citadels in the towne of <hi>Caſtello,</hi> the better to keep the State. <hi>Guidubaldo</hi> Duke of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin</hi> being to returne
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:12126:96"/> into his State, out of which hee was driven by <hi>Caeſar Borgia,</hi> raz'd all the Fortreſſes of that Country, and thought he ſhould hardlyer loſe that State againe without them. The <hi>Bentivolii</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning into <hi>Bolonia,</hi> uſd the like courſes. Citadels then are profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, or not, according to the times, and if they advantage thee in one part, they do thee harme in another, and this part may be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued thus. That Prince, who ſtands more in feare of his owne people than of ſtrangers, ought to build Fortreſſes: but hee that is more afraid of ſtrangers than of his people, ſhould let them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. Againſt the houſe of <hi>Sforza,</hi> the Caſtle of <hi>Milan,</hi> which <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Sforza</hi> built, hath and will make more war, than any other diſorder in that State: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the beſt Citadell that may be, is not to incurre the peoples hatred; for however thou holdſt a Fortreſſe, and the people hate thee, thou canſt hardly ſcape
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:12126:97"/> them: for people, when once they have taken armes, never want the help of ſtrangers at their need, to take their parts. In our dayes we never ſaw, that they ever profited any Prince, unleſſe it were the Counteſſe of <hi>Furli,</hi> when Count <hi>Hieronimo</hi> of <hi>Furli</hi> her husband was ſlaine; for by meanes thereof ſhe eſcap'd the peoples rage, and attended aid from <hi>Milan,</hi> and ſo recoverd her State: and then ſuch were the times that the ſtranger could not aſſiſt the people: but afterwards they ſervd her to little purpoſe, when <hi>Caeſar Borgia</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaild her, and that the people which was her enemy, ſided with the ſtranger. Therefore both then, and at firſt, it would have been more for her ſafety, not to have been odious to the people, than to have held the Fortreſſes. Theſe things being well weigh'd then, I will commend thoſe that ſhall build up Fortreſſes, and him alſo that ſhall not; and I will blame him, howſoever he be that
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:12126:97"/> relying upon thoſe, ſhall make ſmall account of being hated by his people.</p>

               <p>THere is nothing gaines a Prince ſuch repute, as great exployts, and rare trialls of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in Heroicke actions. We have now in our dayes <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Arragon</hi> the preſent King of <hi>Spain:</hi> hee in a manner may be termd a new Prince, for from a very weak King, hee is now become for fame and glory, the firſt King of Chriſtendome, and if you ſhall well conſider his actions, you ſhall find them all illuſtrious, and every one of them extraordinary. Hee in the beginning of his reigne aſſaild <hi>Granada,</hi> and that exployt was the ground of his State. At firſt hee made that warre in ſecurity and without ſuſpicion he ſhould
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:12126:98"/> be any wayes hindred, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in held the Barons of <hi>Caſtiglias</hi> minds buſied, who thinking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that warre, never minded any innovation; and in this while he gaind credit and authority with them, they not being aware of it; was able to maintaine with the Church, and the peoples mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny all his ſouldiers, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d to lay a foundation for his military or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances with that long warre: which afterwards gaind him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding much honour. Beſides this, to the end hee might be able here among to undertake greater matters, ſerving himſelfe alwaies of the colour of religion; hee gave himſelfe to a kind of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cruelty, chaſing and diſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thoſe <hi>Jewes</hi> out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; nor can this example bee more admirable and rare: under the ſame cloke hee invaded <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick</hi> and went through with his exployt in <hi>Italy:</hi> and laſt of all hath hee aſſaild <hi>France,</hi> and ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies proceeded on forwards

                  </gap>r given leyſure to men ſo to reſt, as that they might ever plot any thing againſt them. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over it much availes a Prince to give extraordinary proofes of himſelfe touching the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment within, ſuch as thoſe wee have heard of <hi>Bernard</hi> of <hi>Milan;</hi> whenſoever occaſion is given by any one, that may effectuate ſome great thing either of good or evill, in the civill government; and to finde out ſome way ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to reward or puniſh it, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the world much notice may bee taken.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> fame of his magnificence and worthineſſe. A Prince alſo is well eſteemd, when hee is a true
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:12126:99"/> friend, or a true enemy, when without any regard hee diſcovers himſelfe in favour of one againſt another; which courſe ſhall bee alwayes more profit, than to ſtand neuter: for if two migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ones that are thy neighbours come to fall out, or are of ſuch quality, that one of them van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhing, thou art like to bee in feare of the vanquiſher; or not; in either of theſe two caſes, it will ever prove more for thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to diſcover thy ſelfe, and make a good war of it: for in the firſt caſe, if thou diſcoverſt not thy ſelfe, thou ſhalt alwayes bee a prey to him that overcomes, to the contentment and ſatisfaction of the vanquiſht; neither ſhalt thou have reaſon on thy ſide, nor any thing elſe to defend or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thee. For hee that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes, will not have any ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted freinds, that give him no aſſiſtance in his neceſſity: and hee that loſes, receives thee not, becauſe thou wouldſt not with
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:12126:99"/> thy armes in hand runne the hazzard of his fortune. <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> paſſd into <hi>Greece,</hi> thereunto induc'd by the <hi>Etolians,</hi> to chace the <hi>Romans</hi> thence: and ſent his Ambaſſadors to the <hi>Achayans,</hi> who were the <hi>Romans</hi> friends, to perſwade them to ſtand neuters; on the other ſide the <hi>Romans</hi> mov'd them to joyne armes with theirs: this matter came to bee deliberated on in the counſell of the <hi>Achayans,</hi> where <hi>Antiochus</hi> his Ambaſſadour encouragd them to ſtand neuters, whereunto the <hi>Romans</hi> Ambaſſadour anſwerd. Touching the courſe, that is commended to you, as beſt and profitableſt for your State, to wit, not to intermeddle in the warre between us, nothing can be more againſt you: becauſe, not taking either part, you ſhall remaine without thanks, and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation a prey to the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. And it will alwayes come to paſſe that hee who is not thy freind, will require thy neutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:12126:100"/> and hee that is thy friend, will urge thee, to diſcover thy ſelfe by taking armes for him: and evill adviſd Princes, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd the preſent dangers, follow often times that way of neutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and moſt commonly goe to ruine: but when a Prince diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers himſelfe ſtrongly in favour of a party, if hee to whom thou cleaveſt, overcomes, however that hee be puiſſant, and thou remainſt at his diſpoſing, hee is oblig'd to thee, and there is a contract of friendſhip made; and men are never ſo openly diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, as with ſuch a notorious example of diſhoneſty to oppreſſe thee. Beſides victories are never ſo proſperous, that the conquerour is like to neglect all reſpects, and eſpecially of juſtice. But if he to whom thou ſtickſt, loſes thou art receivd by him; and, while hee is able, hee aydes thee, and ſo thou becomſt partner of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune that may ariſe againe. In the ſecond caſe, when they that
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:12126:100"/> enter into the liſts, together, are of ſuch quality, that thou needſt not feare him that vanquiſheth, ſo much the more is it deſcretion in thee to ſtick to him; for thou goeſt to ruine one with his aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, who ought to doe the beſt hee could to ſave him, if he were well adviſd; and hee overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, is left at thy diſcretion, and it is unpoſſible but with thy ayd he muſt overcome. And here it is to be noted, that a Prince ſhould bee well aware never to joyne with any one more powerfull than himſelfe, to offend another, unleſſe upon neceſſity, as formerly is ſaid. For when he overcomes, thou art left at his diſcretion; and Princes ought avoid as much as they are able, to ſtand at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers diſcretion. The <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> took part with <hi>France</hi> againſt the Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> and yet could have avoided that partake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from which proceeded their ruine. But when it cannot bee avoyded, as it befell the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:12126:101"/> when the Pope and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> went both with their armies to aſſaile <hi>Lombardy,</hi> there the Prince ought to ſide with them for the reaſons afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. Nor let any State think they are able to make ſuch ſure par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but rather that they are all doubtfull; for in the order of things wee find it alwayes, that whenſoever a man ſeeks to avoid one inconvenient; hee incurres another. But the principall point of judgement, is in diſcerning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the qualities of inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, and not taking the bad for the good. Moreover a Prince ought to ſhew himſelf a lover of vertue, and that he honours thoſe that excell in every Art. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ought hee incourage his Citizens, whereby they may bee enabled quickly to exerciſe their faculties as well in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe, and husbandry, as in any other kind of traffick, to the end that no man forbeare to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne and cultivate his poſſeſſions
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:12126:101"/> for feare, that hee be deſpoyld of them; or any other to open the commerce upon the danger of heavy impoſitions: but rather to provide rewards for thoſe that ſhall ſet theſe matters a foot, or for any one elſe that ſhall any way amplifie his City or State. Beſides hee ought in the fit times of the yeare entertain the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with Feaſts and Maskes; and becauſe every City is devided into Companyes, and Arts, and Tribes; hee ought to take ſpeciall notice of thoſe bodies, and ſome times afford them a meeting, and give them ſome proofe of his humanity, and magnificence; yet withall holding firme the majeſtie of his State, for this muſt never faile in any caſe.</p>

               <p>IT is no ſmall importance to a Prince, the choyce he makes of ſervants, being ordinarily

                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:12126:103"/> good, or bad, as his wiſdome is. And the firſt conjecture one gives of a great man, and of his underſtanding, is upon the ſight of his followers and ſervants hee hath about him, when they prove able and faithfull, and then may hee alwayes be reputed wiſe; becauſe hee hath knowne how to diſcerne thoſe that are able, and to keepe them true to him. But when they are otherwiſe, there can be no good conjecture made of him, for the firſt errour hee commits, is in this choyce. There was no man, that had any knowledge of <hi>Antony</hi> of <hi>Vana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fro,</hi> the ſervant of <hi>Pandulfus Petrucci</hi> Prince of <hi>Siena,</hi> who did not eſteeme <hi>Pandulfus</hi> for a very diſcreet man, having him for his ſervant. And becauſe there are three kinds of underſtandings, the one that is adviſd by it ſelfe; the other that underſtands when it is informd by another; the third that neither is adviſd by it ſelfe, nor by the demonſtration of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother;
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:12126:103"/> the firſt is beſt, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is good, and the laſt quite unprofitable. Therefore it was of neceſſity, that if <hi>Pandulfus</hi> attaind not the firſt degree, yet hee got to the ſecond; for when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any one hath the judgement to diſcerne between the good and the evill, that any one does and ſayes, however that hee hath not this invention from himſelfe, yet ſtill comes hee to take notice of the good or evill actions of that ſervant; and thoſe hee che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, and theſe hee ſuppreſſes; inſomuch that the ſervant finding no meanes to deceive his maſter, keeps himſelfe upright and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt. But how a Prince may throughly underſtand his ſervant, here is the way that never failes. When thou ſeeſt, the ſervant ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy more for his owne advantage than thine, and that in all his actions, hee ſearches moſt after his owne profit; this man thus qualified, ſhall never prove good ſervant, nor canſt thou ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:12126:104"/> upon him: for he that holds the ſterne of the State in hand, ought never call home his cares to his owne particular, but give himſelfe wholly over to his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſervice, nor ever put him in mind of any thing not apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to him. And on the other ſide the Prince to keepe him good to him, ought to take a care for his ſervant, honouring him, enriching, and obliging him to him, giving him part both of dignities and offices, to the end that the many honors and much wealth beſtowd on him, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine his deſires from other honours, and other wealth, and that thoſe many charges cauſe him to feare changes that may fall, knowing hee is not able to ſtand without his maſter. And when both the Princes and the ſervants are thus diſpoſd, they may rely the one upon the other: when otherwiſe, the end will ever prove hurtfull for the one as well as for the other.</p>

               <p>I Will not omit one principle of great importance, being an errour from which Princes with much difficulty defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, unleſſe they be very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet, and make a very good choice; and this is concerning flatterers, whereof all writings are full: and that becauſe men pleaſe themſelves ſo much in their owne things, and therein cozen themſelves, that very hardly can they eſcape this peſtilence; and deſiring to eſcape it, there is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of falling into contempt; for there is no other way to bee ſecure from flattery, but to let men know, that they diſpleaſe thee not in telling thee truth: but when every one hath this leave, thou loſeſt thy reverence. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought a wiſe Prince take a third courſe, making choyce of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:12126:105"/> ſome underſtanding men in his State, and give only to them a free liberty of ſpeaking to him the truth; and touching thoſe things only which hee inquires of, and nothing elſe; but hee ought to be inquiſitive of every thing, and heare their opinions, and then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards adviſe himſelfe after his owne manner, and in theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberations, and with every one of them ſo carry himſelfe, that they all know, that the more freely they ſhall ſpeake, the better they ſhall be lik'd of: and beſides thoſe, not give eare to any one, and thus purſue the thing reſolvd on, and thence continue obſtinate in the reſolution taken. Hee who does otherwiſe, either falls upon flatterers, or often changes upon the varying of opinions, from whenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> proceeds it that men conceive but ſlightly of him. To this purpoſe I will alleadge you a moderne example. <hi>Peter Lucas</hi> a ſervant of <hi>Maximilians</hi> the preſent Emperour, ſpeaking
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:12126:105"/> of his Majeſty, ſaid that hee never adviſd with any body, nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did any thing after his owne way: which was becauſe he took a contrary courſe to what wee have now ſaid: for the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour is a cloſe man, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates his ſecrets to none, nor takes counſaile of any one: but as they come to be put in practiſe, they begin to be diſcoverd and knowne, and ſo contradicted by thoſe that are neare about him, and hee as being an eaſie man, is quickly wrought from them. Whence it comes, that what hee does today, hee undoes on the morrow; and that hee never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands himſelf what he would, nor what hee purpoſes, and that there is no grounding upon any of his reſolutions. A Prince therefore ought alwayes to take counſell, but at his owne pleaſure, and not at other mens; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould take away any mans courage to adviſe him of any thing, but what hee askes: but
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:12126:106"/> hee ought well to aske at large; and then touching the things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quird of, be a patient hearer of the truth, and perceiving that for ſome reſpect the truth were conceald from him, be diſpleaſd thereat. And becauſe ſome men have thought, that a Prince, that gaines the opinion to bee wiſe, may be held ſo, not by his owne naturall indowments, but by the good counſells hee hath about him; without queſtion they are deceivd; for this is a generall rule and never failes, that a Prince who of himſelfe is not wiſe, can never bee well adviſd, unleſſe he ſhould light upon one alone, wholly to direct and governe him, who himſelfe were a very wiſe man. In this caſe it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible hee may bee well governd: but this would laſt but little: for that governour in a ſhort time would deprive him of his State; but a Pr nce not having any parts of nature, being adviſd of more than one, ſhall never bee
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:12126:106"/> able to unite theſe counſells: of himſelfe ſhall hee never know how to unite them, and each one of the counſellers, probably will follow that which is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly his owne; and hee ſhall never finde the meanes to amend or diſcerne theſe things, nor can they fall out otherwiſe, becauſe men alwayes prove miſchievous, unleſſe up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>In this Chapter our Authour preſcribes ſome rules how to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd flattery, and not to fall into contempt. The extent of theſe two extreames is ſo large on both ſides, that there is left but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry narrow path for the right tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to walke between them both: and happy were that Prince, who could

                     <hi>To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe therefore ſayes one, a Prince excells in learning to ride the great horſe, rather than in any other excerciſe: becauſe his horſe being no flatterer, will ſhew him hee makes no difference between him and another man, and unleſſe hee keepe his ſeate-well, will lay him on the ground. This is plaine deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Men are more ſubtile, more double heatred, they have a heart &amp; a heart, neither is their tongue their hearts true interpreter. Counſell in the heart of man is like deepe waters; but a man of underſtanding will draw it out.</hi> Prov. 20.5. <hi>This underſtanding is moſt requiſite in a Prince, inasmuch as the whole
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:12126:108"/> Globe is in his hand, and the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Orbes are ſwayed by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the higheſt. And therefore ſurely it is the honour of a King to ſearch out ſuch a ſecret:</hi> Prov. 25.2. <hi>His counſellours are his eyes and eares; as they ought to be deare to him, ſo they ought to be true to him, and make him the true report of things without diſguiſe. If they prove falſe eyes, let him pluck them out, hee may as they uſe glaſſe eyes take them forth without paine, and ſee never a whit the worſe for it. The wiſdome of a Princes Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours is a great argument of the Princes wiſdome. And being the choyce of them imports the Princes credit and ſafety, our Authour will make him amends for his other errours by his good advice in his</hi> 22. <hi>Chap. whether I referre him.</hi>

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:12126:109"/> a Prince, and by reaſon of his ſmall diſcretion hath loſt it. And if we ſhall conſider thoſe Lords, that in <hi>Italy</hi> have loſt their States in our dayes, as the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; firſt we ſhall find in them a common defect, touching their armes, for the reaſons which have been above diſcourſd, at length. Afterwards we ſhall ſee ſome of them, that either ſhall have had the people for their enemies; or be it they had the people to friend, could never know how to aſſure themſelves of the great ones: for without ſuch defects as theſe, States are not loſt, which have ſo many nerves, that they are able to maintaine an army in the field. <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> not the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, but he that was vanquiſhd by <hi>Titus Quintius,</hi> had not much State in regard of the greatneſſe of the <hi>Romanes</hi> and of <hi>Greece</hi> that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſail'd him; nevertheleſſe in that he was a warlike man and knew

Wherefore theſe our Princes who for many yeares had continued in their Principalities, for having afterwards loſt them, let them not blame Fortune, but their own ſloth; becauſe they never having thought during the times of quiet, that they could ſuffer a change (which is the common fault of men, while faire weather laſts, not to provide for the tempeſt) when afterwards miſchiefes came upon them, thought rather upon flying from them, than upon their defence, and hop'd that the people, weary of the vanquiſhers inſolence, would recall them: which courſe when the others faile, is good: but very ill is it to leave the other remedies for that: for a man wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>IT is not unknown unto me, how that many have held opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and ſtill hold it, that the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of the world are ſo governd by fortune, and by God, that men by their wiſdome cannot a mend or alter them; or rather that there is no remedy for them: and hereupon they would think that it were of no availe to take much paines in any thing, but leave all to be governd by chance.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:12126:110"/> This opinion hath gain'd the more credit in our dayes, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the great alteration of things, which wee have of late ſeen, and do every day ſee, beyond all humane conjecture: upon which, I ſometimes thinking, am in ſome part inclind to their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: nevertheleſſe not to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh quite our own free will, I think it may be true, that Fortune is the miſtreſſe of one halfe of our actions; but yet that ſhe lets us have rule of the other halfe, or lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle leſſe. And I liken her to a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitous torrent, which when it rages, over-flows the plaines, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrowes the trees, and build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, removes the earth from one ſide, and laies it on another, every one flyes before it, every one yeelds to the fury thereof, as una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to withſtand it; and yet how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be thus, when the times are calmer, men are able to make proviſion againſt theſe exceſſes, with banks and fences ſo, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards when it ſwels again, it

And if you ſhall conſider <hi>Italy,</hi> which is the ſeat of theſe changes, and that which hath given them their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you ſhall ſee it to be a plaine field, without any trench or banck; which had it been fenc'd with convenient vertue, as was <hi>Germany, Spaine,</hi> or <hi>France;</hi> this inundation would never have cauſd theſe great alterations it hath, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I beleeve alſo, that he proves the fortunate man, whoſe manner of proceeding meets with the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the times: and ſo likewiſe he unfortunate, from whoſe courſe of proceeding the times differ: for we ſee that men, in the things that induce them to the end, (which every one propounds to himſelfe, as glory and riches) proceed therein diverſly; ſome with reſpects, others more bold, and raſhly; one with violence, and th'other with cunning; the one with patience, th'other with its contrary; and every one by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall ways may attaine thereto.

Conſider the firſt exploit he did at <hi>Bolonia,</hi> even while <hi>John Bentivolio</hi> liv'd: the <hi>Venetians</hi> were not well conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therewith; the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> likewiſe with the <hi>French,</hi> had treated of that enterpriſe; and notwithſtanding all this, hee ſtirrd up by his own rage and fierceneſſe, perſonally undertook that expedition: which action of his put in ſuſpence and ſtopt <hi>Spaine</hi> and the <hi>Venitians,</hi> thoſe
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:12126:113"/> for feare, and th'others for deſire to recover the Kingdome of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;</hi> and on th'other part drew after him the King of <hi>France:</hi> for that King ſeeing him already in motion, and deſiring to hold him his friend, whereby to humble the <hi>Venetians,</hi> thought he could no way deny him his ſouldiers, without doing him an open inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. <hi>Julius</hi> then effected that with his violent and heady motion, which no other Pope with all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wiſdome could ever have done; for if hee had expected to part from <hi>Rome</hi> with his conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſettled, and all his affaires ordered before hand, as any other Pope would have done, hee had never brought it to paſſe: For the King of <hi>France</hi> would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſd a thouſand excuſes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers would have put him in as many feares. I will let paſſe his other actions, for all of them were alike, and all of them prov'd lucky to him; and the brevity of his life never ſufferd him to feele
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:12126:113"/> the contrary: for had he litt upon ſuch times afterwards, that it had been neceſſary for him to proceed with reſpects, there had been his utter ruine; for hee would never have left thoſe wayes, to which he had been naturally inclind. I conclude then, fortune varying, and men continuing ſtill obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to their own wayes, prove happy, while theſe accord toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and as they diſagree, prove unhappy: and I think it true, that it is better to be heady, than wary: becauſe Fortune is a miſtreſſe; and it is neceſſary, to keep her in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, to ruffle and force her: and we ſee, that ſhe ſuffers her ſelfe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be maſterd by thoſe, than by others that proceed coldly. And therefore, as a miſtreſſe, ſhee is a friend to young men, becauſe they are leſſe reſpective, more rough, and command her with more boldneſſe.</p>

                     <hi>I have conſidered the</hi> 25 <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as repreſenting me a full view of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:12126:114"/> humane policy and cunning: yet me thinks it cannot ſatisfie a Christian in the cauſes of the good and bad ſucceſſe of things. The life of man is like a game at Tables; skill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes much I grant, but that's not all: play thy game well, but that will not winne: the chance thou throwest must accord with thy play. Examine this; play never ſo ſurely, play never ſo probably; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the chance thou castest, lead thee forward to advantage, all ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards are loſſes, and thy ſure play leaves thee in the lurch. The ſum of this is ſet down in</hi> Eccleſiaſtes chap. 9. v. 11. <hi>The race is not to the ſwift, nor the battell to the ſtrong; neither yet bread to the wiſe, nor yet riches to men of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all. Our cunning Author for all his exact rules he delivers in his books, could not fence against the despight of Fortune, as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines in his Epistle to this booke. Nor that great example of policy,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:12126:114"/> Duke</hi> Valentine, <hi>whom our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor commends to Princes for his crafts-master, could ſo ruffle or forcc his mistreſſe Fortune, that he could keep her in obedience. Man can contribute no more to his actions than vertue and wiſdome: but the ſucceſſe depends upon a power above. Surely there is the finger of God: or as</hi> Prov. <hi>the</hi> 16. v. 33. <hi>The lot is cast into the lap, but the whole di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſing thereof is of the Lord. It was not</hi> Joſephs <hi>wiſdom made all things thrive under his hand; but becauſe the Lord was with him, and that which he did, the Lord made it to prosper.</hi> Gen. 39. <hi>Surely this is a bleſſing proceeding from the divine providence, which beyond humane capacity ſo cooperateth with the cauſes, as that their effects prove anſwerable, and ſometimes (that we may know there is ſomething above the ordinary cauſes) the ſucceſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes with ſuch a ſupereminency of worth, that it farr exceeds the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the ordinary cauſes.</hi>

And however even in theſe later dayes, wee have had ſome kinde of ſhew of hope in ſome one, whereby wee might have conjectur'd, that hee had been ordeind for the deliverance hereof, yet it prov'd afterwards, that in the very height of all his actions hee was curb'd by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, inſomuch that this poore countrey remaining as it were without life, attends ſtill for him
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:12126:116"/> that ſhall heale her wounds, give an end to all thoſe pilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings and ſackings of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> to thoſe robberies and taxations of the Kingdome, and of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> and heale them of their ſoares, now this long time gangren'd. We ſee how ſhe makes her pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God, that he ſend ſome one to redeem her from theſe Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous cruelties and inſolences. We ſee her alſo wholly ready and diſpoſd to follow any colours, provided there bee any one to take them up. Nor doe we ſee at this preſent, that ſhee can look for other, than your Illuſtrious Family, to become Cheiftaine of this deliverance, which hath now by its owne Vertue and Fortune been ſo much exalted, and favourd by God and the Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it now holds the Principality: and this ſhall not be very hard for you to doe, if you ſhall call to minde the former actions, and lives of thoſe that are above named. And though thoſe men
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:12126:116"/> were very rare and admirable, yet were they men, and every one of them began upon leſſe occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than this; for neither was their enterpriſe more juſt than this, nor more eaſie; nor was God more their friend, than yours. Here is very great juſtice: for that warre is juſt, that is neceſſary; and thoſe armes are religious, when there is no hope left otherwhere, but in them. Here is an exceeding good diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition thereto: nor can there be, where there is a good diſpoſition, a great difficulty, provided that uſe bee made of thoſe orders, which I propounded for ayme and direction to you. Beſides this, here we ſee extraordinary things without example effected by God; the ſea was opened, a cloud guided the way, devotion powrd forth the waters, and it raind downe manna; all theſe things have concurrd in your greatneſſe, the reſt is left for you to doe. God will not doe every
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:12126:117"/> thing himſelf, that he may not take from us our free will, and part of that glory that belongs to us. Neither is it a marvell, if any of the aforenamd <hi>Italians</hi> have not been able to compaſſe that, which wee may hope your Illuſtrious family ſhall: though in ſo many revolutions of <hi>Italy,</hi> and ſo many ſeats of warr, it may ſeeme that the whole military vertue therein be quite extinguiſht; for this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes from that the ancient orders thereof were not good; and there hath ſince been none that hath knowne how to invent new ones. Nothing can ſo much honour a man riſing anew, as new lawes and new ordinances deviſd by him: theſe things when they have a good foundation given them, and containe in them their due greatneſſe, gaine him reverence and admiration; and in <hi>Italy</hi> their wants not the matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to introduce any forme. Here is great vertue in the members, were it not wanting in the heads.
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:12126:117"/> Conſider in the ſingle fights that have been, and duells, how much the <hi>Jtalians</hi> have excell'd in their ſtrength, activity and adreſſe; but when they come to armies, they appeare not, and all proceeds from the weakneſſe of the Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines; for they that underſtand the managing of theſe matters, are not obeyd, and every one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes to underſtand; hitherto there having not been any one ſo highly raiſd either by fortune or vertue, as that others would ſubmit unto him. From hence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds it, that in ſo long time, and in ſo many battles fought for theſe laſt paſt 20 yeers, when there hath been an army wholly <hi>Italian,</hi> it alwayes hath had evill ſucceſſe; whereof the river <hi>Tarus</hi> firſt was witneſſe, afterwards <hi>Alexandria, Capua, Genua, Vay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, Bolonia, Mestri.</hi> Your Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious family then being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to tread the footſteps of theſe Worthyes who redeemd their countryes, muſt above all things
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:12126:118"/> as the very foundation of the whole fabrick, be furniſhd with ſouldiers of your owne natives: becauſe you cannot have more faithfull, true, nor better ſouldiers; and though everyone of them be good, all together they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come better when they ſhall find themſelves entertaind, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and honourd by their owne Prince. Wherefore it is neceſſary to provide for thoſe armes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to be able with the <hi>Italian</hi> valour to make a defence againſt forreiners. And however the <hi>Swiſſe</hi> infantery and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> bee accounted terrible; yet is there defect in both of them, by which a third order might not only oppoſe them, but may bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident to vanquiſh them: for the <hi>Spanyards</hi> are not able to indure the Horſe, and the <hi>Swiſſe</hi> are to feare the Foot, when they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with them as reſolute in the fight as they. Whereupon it hath been ſeene, and upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ſhall bee certaine, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:12126:118"/> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are not able to beare up againſt the <hi>French</hi> Cavalery, and the <hi>Swiſſes</hi> have been routed by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Foot. And though touching this laſt, there hath not been any entire experience had, yet was there ſome proofe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of given in the battell of <hi>Raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> when the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Foot affron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Dutch</hi> batallions, which keepe the ſame ranke the <hi>Swiſſes</hi> doe, where the <hi>Spanyards</hi> with their nimbleneſſe of body, and the help of their targets entred in under their Pikes, and there ſtood ſafe to offend them; the <hi>Dutch</hi> men having no remedy: and had it not been for the Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery that ruſhd in upon them, they had quite defeated them. There may then (the defect of the one and the other of theſe two infanteries being diſcoverd) another kind of them bee anew ordaind, which may bee able to make reſiſtance againſt the Horſe, and not feare the Foot, which ſhall not be a new ſort of armes,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:12126:119"/> but a change of orders. And theſe are ſome of thoſe things which ordaind anew, gaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and greatneſſe to a new Prince. Therefore this occaſion ſhould not bee let paſſe, to the end that <hi>Italy</hi> after ſo long a time may ſee ſome one redeemer of hers appeare. Nor can I expreſſe with what dearneſſe of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hee would be receiv'd in all thoſe countryes which have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd by thoſe forrein ſcumms, with what thirſt of revenge, with what reſolution of fidelity, with what piety, with what teares. Would any gates bee ſhut againſt him? Any people deny him obedience? Any envy oppoſe him? Would not every <hi>Italian</hi> fully conſent with him? This government of the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> ſtinks in every ones noſtrills. Let your Illuſtrious Family then undertake this worthy exployt with that courage and thoſe hopes wherewith ſuch juſt actions are to be attempted; to the end that
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:12126:119"/> under your colours, this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try may be ennobled, and under the protection of your Fortune that ſaying of <hi>Petrarch</hi> bee veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyd.</p>

I am indeed of opinion that it proceeds from hence, <hi>viz.</hi> in that Fortune willing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate unto the World, that ſhe, and not Wiſdome, gives men their greatneſſe, therefore begins to ſhew her ſtrength at ſuch a time, when Wiſdome can chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge no intereſt, but all rather is to bee attributed as due to her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. <hi>Castruccio Castracani</hi> of <hi>Lucca</hi> was then one of thoſe, who in regard of the times hee liv'd in, and the City where he was borne, effected very great matters, and had, as others in this kind, neither a very fortunate nor known birth, as in my further diſcourſe of his life it ſhall appeare: which I thought fit to bring to memory, as having found therein a ſubject
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:12126:121"/> of very great example, as well in regard of valour, as fortune. And I thought I might the better di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect this diſcourſe unto you two, who of all that I know moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in ſuch glorious atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

Of this there was one <hi>Antony</hi> borne, who took upon him religious orders, and was a <hi>Canon</hi> of S. <hi>Michaels</hi> at <hi>Lucca,</hi> and in honour thereof was entitled Maſter <hi>Antony.</hi> He had but one ſiſter, who was married to <hi>Buonaccorſo Cennami;</hi> but <hi>Buo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naccorſo</hi> being dead, &amp; ſhe remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a widdow, betook her ſelfe to live with her brother, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention not to marry any more. Maſter <hi>Antony</hi> had behind his houſe where he dwelt, a vineyard, whereinto by reaſon of divers gardens bordering thereupon on
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:12126:122"/> ſeverall ſides, the paſſage was very ordinary. It happened that one morning a little after the Sunne riſe, Dame <hi>Dionora,</hi> for ſo was Maſter <hi>Antonies</hi> ſiſter cald, walking out into the vineyard, as ſhe was gathering ſome herbs, after the manner of women, to make a ſallet withall; ſhee heard ſome kind of ruſſeling under a vine amongſt the leaves, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting her eye that way, ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd ſome little cry there: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon drawing neare to the noiſe, ſhe diſcover'd the hands and face of an infant, wrapt in the vine leaves, which ſeem'd as if it ask'd her aſſiſtance: ſo that ſhe partly mervayling, partly frighted, full of pity and amazement, tooke it up in her armes: and having car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it home, and waſh'd it, and ſwaddled it in cleane clouts, as they uſe children; at her returne preſented it to Maſter <hi>Antony:</hi> who conſidering the accident, and ſeeing the child, was as much amaz'd and compaſſionate as was
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:12126:122"/> his ſiſter: and adviſing together what they ſhould do in this caſe, reſolved to bring it up, he being a Prieſt, and ſhe not having any children.

               <hi>Lucca,</hi> and aſſembling morning and evening, with the reſt of the citizens under the Governours Palace, which is in the head of the place of S. <hi>Michael,</hi> being the prime place of <hi>Lucca;</hi> oftentimes ſaw <hi>Castruccio</hi> uſing of thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes with other lads of the towne, wherein I formerly ſaid he took delight; and perceiving that beſides the maſtering of them, he held over them a kind of Princely authority, and that they again lov'd and reverenc'd him, he became very deſirous to know what he was: whereof being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by ſome there preſent, hee became the more deſirous to take him home to him; and calling him one day to him, ask'd him, where he had rather live, either in a Cavaliers houſe, when he might learne to ride and uſe his armes, or a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>e in a Prieſts houſe, where nothing elſe were to be heard but their Offices and Maſſes? Maſter <hi>Francis</hi> perceiv'd how much <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruccio</hi> was cheer'd upon the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:12126:124"/> mention of horſes and armes; yet he ſtanding a little out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, Mr. <hi>Francis</hi> again encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging him to ſpeak, he anſwerd, that if his Patron would therwith be content, hee could not have a greater pleaſure, than to quit this calling of Prieſt, and betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to that of a Souldier. Maſter <hi>Francis</hi> was much ſatisfy'd with this reply: and in a ſhort time ſo negociated in this matter, that Maſter <hi>Antony</hi> gave him up to his charge, whereunto hee was the rather mov'd by the lads incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, judgeing thereby that he could not hold him much longer in his former courſe. <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> then being preferr'd from Maſter <hi>Antony Caſtracani</hi> the Prieſts houſe, to the Palace of Maſter <hi>Francis Guinigi</hi> the Commander; it was a marvaile to think in how ſhort a time hee attain'd to thoſe vertues and good qualities, which are requir'd in a compleate Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liere. Firſt he became an excellent horſeman: for he was able to
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:12126:124"/> manage the rougheſt horſe at eaſe, and, though but a youth, in jouſts and tournaments hee was of prime remarque; ſo that in any action of ſtrength or activity, none could exceed him. Theſe perfections beſides, were ſeaſon'd with ſuch manners, and good qualities, as that touching mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, it was incredible how that either in word or deed he gave no diſtaſte to any; to his ſuperiours he yeelded reverence; he was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt with his equals, and pleaſant with his inferiours; which gain'd him favour, not only in the whole Family of <hi>Guinigi,</hi> but alſo in the whole City of <hi>Lucca.</hi> It chanc'd in thoſe times, <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> being now arriv'd to eighteen yeares of age, that the <hi>Gibellins</hi> were chaſd by the <hi>Guelfes</hi> from <hi>Pavia,</hi> in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of whom Maſter <hi>Francis Guinigi</hi> was ſent for by the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>county of <hi>Milan,</hi> with whom went <hi>Caſtruccio,</hi> as hee on whoſe ſhoulders lay the charge of the whole troops: in which imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:12126:125"/> 
               <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> gave ſuch proofs of his judgement and courage, that not one in this expedition gain'd ſo much eſteeme as he, and his name became honourable, not only in <hi>Pavia,</hi> but throughout all <hi>Lombardy. Caſtruccio</hi> being then return'd to <hi>Lucca</hi> of far greater eſteeme, than before his departure he was; fayl'd not (to his power) to gaine himſelfe friends, practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing meanes to win them. But Maſter <hi>Francis Guinigi</hi> now chancing to dye, and having left behind him a ſon nam'd <hi>Paul</hi> of 13 yeares of age; appointed <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruccio</hi> his Tutor, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of his eſtate; having firſt cauſd him to bee cald to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death, and intreated him, that he would take upon him the care to bring up his ſon, with that faithfulneſſe he had found himſelfe, and that what kindneſſes he could not returne to the father, he would requite to the ſon. And now at length Maſter <hi>Francis Guinigi</hi> being dead, <hi>Castruccio</hi>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:12126:125"/> left Tutour and Governour to <hi>Paul,</hi> grew in ſuch credit and power, that the favour hee was wont to find in <hi>Lucca,</hi> in ſome part was turn'd into envy, and he was calumniated by many, as who they doubted had ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects upon a tyranny. Among who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the principall was M. <hi>George Opizi,</hi> head of the <hi>Guelfes</hi> facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This man hoping by the death of Mr. <hi>Francis,</hi> to remaine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out competitour in <hi>Lucca,</hi> thought that <hi>Caſtruccio,</hi> being left with that truſt, by the grace and favour his diſcret carriage gain'd him, had bereav'd him of all meanes, to attaine thereto; and hereupon ſowed many ſeeds of ſcandall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, whereby to choake his well-grown credit. Which at firſt <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> diſdeign'd, but afterwards grew jealous of it: for he thought that Maſter <hi>George</hi> would never reſt, till he had ſo far diſgrac'd him with King <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> of <hi>Naples</hi> his Lievftenant, as to cauſe him to chaſe him out of

               <hi>Lucca.</hi> At that time there was one <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>guccion</hi> of <hi>Fagginolo</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rezo,</hi> then Lord of <hi>Piſa,</hi> who by the <hi>Piſans</hi> was firſt choſen for their Commander, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards made himſelfe their Lord.

In this place <hi>Castruccio</hi> had a deſigne to encounter with the enemy, as well becauſe his ſmall troops ſhould have the advantage, as not to diſcover the enemy, but juſt upon the skirmiſh, fearing leſt his men ſeeing the number of the enemies, ſhould be ſtartled.

And having very neare acquaintance with one of the inhabitants of the place, he ſo appointed his buſineſs with him, that the night before the skirmiſh was to begin, he ſhould take into the town 400 men of his, and ſlay the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and abiding thus prepared, he ſtirred not his army from Mount <hi>Carlo,</hi> the more to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the <hi>Florentines</hi> to paſſe, who, becauſe they deſired to carry the war far off from <hi>Piſtoya,</hi> and to bring it into the Vale of <hi>Nievole,</hi> encamped under <hi>Serravalle,</hi> with intention the day following to paſſe the hill; but <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving without any noyſe taken the Caſtle in the night, parted from Mount <hi>Carlo</hi> about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, and quietly arrived in the morning at the foot of <hi>Serra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valle,</hi> ſo that at the ſame inſtant

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:12126:141"/> ſome there was that bewrayd his plot to <hi>Caſtruccio:</hi> neither paſſd this diſcovery without the infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of <hi>Bonifacio Cerchi</hi> and <hi>John Guidi Florentines,</hi> who were neare neighbours to <hi>Piſa;</hi> whereupon <hi>Benedicto</hi> being layd hand on, was put to death, and all the reſt of that Family baniſht, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Noble Citizens behea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: and thinking with himſelfe that <hi>Pistoya</hi> and <hi>Piſa</hi> were not very faithfull unto him, he tooke care both by his induſtry and forces to ſecure himſelfe thereof: which gave leyſure to the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> to recover their ſtrength, and to be able to attend the returne of <hi>Charles:</hi> who being arriv'd, they determined to loſe no longer time, and gatherd a great number of men; for they calld together to their ayd in a manner all the <hi>Guelfes</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and made an exceeding great army of more than 30000 Foot, and 10000 Horſe: and having adviſd, which were firſt to bee aſſaild,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:12126:141"/> either <hi>Piſtoya,</hi> or <hi>Piſa,</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd it were better to ſet firſt upon <hi>Piſa,</hi> being a thing more likely to ſucceed, by reaſon of the late conſpiracy there, as alſo of more profit, deeming that if <hi>Piſa</hi> were once gotten, <hi>Piſtoya</hi> would ſoone render of it ſelfe. The <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines</hi> then going forth with this army in the beginning of May 1328, ſuddenly tooke <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stra, Signia,</hi> Mount <hi>Lupo,</hi> and <hi>Empoli,</hi> and came with their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to St. <hi>Miniato. Caſtruccio</hi> on the other part perceiving this great army, which the <hi>Florentines</hi> had brought againſt him, was nothing ſtartled, but rather thought that this was the time, when Fortune was to give him in his hand the whole dominion of <hi>Tuſcany:</hi> beleeving they ſhould have no better ſucceſſe in this of <hi>Piſa,</hi> than formerly they had in that of <hi>Serravalle;</hi> and that now they could not hope to repaire themſelves againe, as then; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon aſſembling twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:12126:142"/> Foot and 4000 Horſe, hee brought his army to <hi>Fucechio,</hi> and ſent <hi>Paul Guinigi</hi> with 5000 Foot to <hi>Piſa. Fucechio</hi> is ſeated in a ſtronger place than any other Caſtle, upon the territory of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi> becauſe it is in the midſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Guſciana</hi> and the <hi>Arno,</hi> and a little raiſd from the plaine; where he abiding, the enemies were not able, unleſſe they divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their army into two parts, to hinder his proviſion either from <hi>Lucca,</hi> or <hi>Piſa;</hi> neither could they but upon diſadvantage either come upon him, or goe towards <hi>Piſa:</hi> for in one caſe they might be incloſd in the midſt between <hi>Caſtruccios</hi> troopes, and thoſe of <hi>Piſa;</hi> in the other caſe, having the <hi>Arno</hi> to paſſe, they could not doe it with the enemy on their backs, without very great danger. And <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> for their incouragement to undertake the paſſage had not plac d himſelfe with his troopes along the banke of <hi>Arno,</hi> but a little aſide neare
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:12126:142"/> unto the walls of <hi>Fucechio,</hi> and had left diſtance enough between the River and him. The <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> having gotten St. <hi>Miniato,</hi> adviſd whether were to be done, either to goe to <hi>Piſa,</hi> or to find out <hi>Caſtruccio;</hi> and having mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured the difficulties of both cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, they reſolvd to goe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt him. The river <hi>Arno</hi> was ſo low that a man might wade over it, but yet not ſo, but that the infantery was wet to the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and the Horſe even to the ſaddle. Upon the tenth day then of June in the morning, the <hi>Florentines</hi> in battell array, cauſd part of their Cavalery to begin to paſſe, and a body of ten thouſand Foot. <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> who ſtood ready and intent to what hee had in his mind to doe, with a batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of five thouſand Foot and three thouſand Horſe fell upon them: neither give hee them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time to get out of the water but that hee was at blowes with them; hee ſent a thouſand light
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:12126:143"/> armd Foot up by the banke on that part under the <hi>Arno,</hi> and a thouſand above it. The <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> Foot were mueh diſtreſſed with the water and weight of their armes, nor had they all yet got over the channell of the river. When ſome of the Horſe had paſſd, by reaſon that they had moord the bottome of the <hi>Arno,</hi> they made the paſſage the unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier for them that came after them; for the bottome proving rotten and miry, ſome of the Horſe came over and over on their riders, and many ſtuck ſo faſt in the mud that they were there ſtabled: whereupon the <hi>Florentine</hi> Commanders ſeeing the difficulty to paſſe on that part, cauſd them to retire and make proofe of a higher part of the river, whereby to finde a ſounder bottome, and the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell more favorable for their paſſage: againſt whom thoſe whom <hi>Castruccio</hi> had ſent under the banke, made reſiſtance, who
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:12126:143"/> ſlightly armd with targets and darts in their hands, with huge outcryes, wounded them both in the face and breſt, inſomuch that the horſes affrighted both with the cryes and ſtrokes, would in no wiſe paſſe forwards, but fell foule one upon another: the fight between <hi>Caſtruccio's</hi> men and those that were already paſt, was ſharp and terrible, and of each ſide there fell many, and every one uſd all his skill and ſtrength to overcome his adverſary. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruccio's</hi> men would force them back into the river; the <hi>Florentines</hi> ſtriv'd to put forwards to make place for others, that being come forth of the water, they might be able to ſtand to the fight, to which obſtinacy there was added the Captaines encouragements. <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> put his men in mind, that theſe were the ſame enemies, which but a little while agoe they had beaten at <hi>Sarravalle.</hi> The <hi>Florentines</hi> reproachd theirs, that they being many, ſhould ſuffer a
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:12126:144"/> few to overcome them. But <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruccio</hi> perceiving that the fight laſted, and that his owne and his adverſaries were well wearied, and that on each ſide many were hurt and ſlaine, hee ſent out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother band of five thouſand Foot, and when hee brought them up to the very back of his owne that fought, hee gave order that they before ſhould open, and wheele about, one on the right hand, the other on the left, and ſo retire; which thing done gave roome to the <hi>Florentines</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and gaine ſome ground. But when once they came to handy blowes, the freſh men with thoſe that were tir'd, they ſtaid not long ere they forc'd them back into the river, between the Horſe of the one ſide, and the other, yet there was not much advantage: whereupon <hi>Castruccio</hi> knowing his owne inferiour, had given order to the leaders, that they ſhould only maintaine fight, as hee that hop'd to overcome
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:12126:144"/> the Foot; which done, he might bee able with more eaſe to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Horſe; which fell out as hee purpoſd: for having ſeene the Foot forc'd back into the river, hee ſent the reſt of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantery againſt the enemies Horſe, who with lances and darts woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them, and the Cavalery al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo preſſing them with greater fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, put them to flight. The <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine</hi> Commanders ſeeing the difficulty that their Horſe had to paſſe; ſtrove to make their Foot paſſe on that part beneath the river, to fight with the flanke of <hi>Caſtruccio's</hi> troops. But the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell being deep, and all above already poſſeſt by his men, all this prov'd vaine. Whereupon the whole army was put to rout, to <hi>Caſtruccio's</hi> great glory and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and of ſo great a multitude there eſcap'd not a third. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chieftaines were taken, and <hi>Charles</hi> ſonne of King <hi>Robert,</hi> together with <hi>Michaelangelo Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coni,</hi> and <hi>Taddeo</hi> of the <hi>Albizi
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:12126:145"/> Florentine</hi> Commiſſaries, fled thence to <hi>Empoli.</hi> The ſpoyle taken was great, the ſlaughter exeeeding great, as a man may imagine in ſuch and ſo great a conflict: for of the <hi>Florentine</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my 20231, and of <hi>Caſtruccio's</hi> part 1570 were left dead upon the place. But Fortune being enemy to his glory, when as ſhe ſhould have given him life, took it from him, and interrupted thoſe deſignes which hee a long time before had purpoſd to put in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: neither could any thing but death hinder him. <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> had toyld himſelfe all that day in the battell, when at the end thereof all weary and ſweaty, he ſtayd about the port of <hi>Fucechio,</hi> to attend the ſouldiers, as they ſhould returne from the victory, and in perſon receive and thank them, and partly if peradventure any thing ſhould ariſe from the enemyes, that they had made head in any place, hee might bee ready to give order thereto: judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:12126:145"/> it the office of a good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, to be the firſt to get a Horſe-back, and the laſt to light off. Whereupon hee ſtanding expoſd to a wind, which ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily about midday riſes upon the <hi>Arno,</hi> and uſes to be peſtiferous, hee was all over chill'd. Which thing not being made account of by him, was the occaſion of his death: for the night following hee was taken with a dangerous feaver, which continually aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting, and the ſickneſſe being judg'd mortall by all the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> perceiving of it, calld <hi>Paul Guinigi,</hi> and ſpake to him theſe words. Had I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leev'd, my ſonne, that Fortune would have cut off my courſe in the midſt of the way, to arrive unto that glory, which I by my ſo many good ſucceſſes had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſd my ſelfe, I ſhould have leſſe wearied my ſelfe, and to thee as I ſhould have left a ſmaller eſtate, ſo alſo fewer enemies, and leſſe envy: for I would have been
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:12126:146"/> content with the dominion of <hi>Lucca</hi> and <hi>Piſa,</hi> and never ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd the <hi>Piſtoyeſes,</hi> nor with ſo many injuries provoked the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines;</hi> but by making the one and the other of theſe people my freinds, I ſhould have led a life, though not longer, yet ſurely more quiet; and to thee ſhould I have left an eſtate, though leſſe, without doubt, more ſecure and firme: but Fortune, who will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of all humane affayres, gave mee not ſo much judgement, that I was able firſt to know it, or ſo much time, that I was able to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome it. Thou haſt heard, for many have told thee, and I never denyd it to thee, how I came into thy fathers houſe being yet a young lad, and voyd of all thoſe hopes, which every gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſpirit ought to conceive, and how I was by him brought up, and belov d by him as much as if I had been of his own blood, whereupon under his government I became valourous, and grew
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:12126:146"/> capable of that fortune, in which thou haſt and doſt ſee mee: and becauſe at his death, hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted thee and all his fortunes to my fidelity, I have brought thee up with that affection, and increaſd them with that fidelity, that I was and am bound to. And becauſe not only whether that alone which was left thee by thy father, but that alſo which my fortune and valour got, were thine, I never would marry, to the end that the love of children ſhould never take mee off, from ſhewing in any part that thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe towards thy fathers blood, which I thought I was oblig'd to ſhew. I leave thee therefore a very faire State, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at I am much pleaſd: but for that I leave it thee weake and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettled, I am exceedingly grieved: there remaines to thee the City of <hi>Lucca,</hi> which will never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to live under thy govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: <hi>Piſa</hi> is alſo thine: wherein there are men naturally incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:12126:147"/> and full of treachery: which, however it bee divers times accuſtomed to ſerve, yet will it alwayes diſdaine to have a <hi>Luccheſe</hi> for its Lord. <hi>Piſtoya</hi> likewiſe is left to thee, very little faithfull to thee, becauſe it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and by freſh injuries pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd againſt our Family. Thou haſt the <hi>Florentines</hi> for thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and thoſe offended, and divers wayes injuryed by us, and not extinguiſht, to whom the news of my death would be more welcome than the Conqueſt of all <hi>Tuſcany.</hi> Thou canſt not rely upon the Princes of <hi>Milan,</hi> nor upon the Emperour, becauſe they are far hence, lazy, and very ſlow with their ſuccours: wherefore thou oughtſt not to hope in any thing, but in thy owne induſtry, and the remembrance of my va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and in the reputation which this preſent victory gaines thee: which if thou ſhalt know with diſcretion how to make uſe of, will ayd thee to make an accord
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:12126:147"/> with the <hi>Florentines,</hi> who being affrighted at this preſent defeate, ought with deſire to condiſcend thereto: whom though I ſought to make them mine enemies, and thought it would procure mee both power and glory, yet thou art by all meanes to ſeeke to gaine for thy friends; for their friendſhip will prove thy ſecurity and advantage. It is a thing of very much importance in this world for a man to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his owne ſelfe, and to know how to meaſure the forces of his owne courage and State; and he that finds himſelfe unfit for warr, ſhould endeavour to ſettle his government by the rules of peace, whereunto thou ſhalt doe well if by my advice thou addreſſe thy ſelfe, and ſtrive by this way to enjoy my paines, and dangers, which ſhall eaſily prove ſucceſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to thee, when thou ſhalt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count theſe my advertiſements true: and herewithall thou ſhalt be doubly oblig'd to mee, firſt
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:12126:148"/> that I have left thee this State, and ſecondly that I have taught thee how to keepe it. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards having cauſd thoſe citizens to come to him, who of <hi>Lucca, Piſa,</hi> and <hi>Piſtoya,</hi> ſerv'd in the warres under him, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended <hi>Paul Guinigi</hi> to them, and made them to ſweare obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him, hee dyed; lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to all thoſe, that ever knew him, a happy remembrancc of him; and to thoſe that had been his friends, ſo great a deſire of him, that never any Prince, that died at any time, left more. His funeralls were moſt honourably ſolemnizd, and hee was buried at St. <hi>Franceſco</hi> in <hi>Lucca.</hi> But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther valour, nor fortune were ſo favourable to <hi>Paul Guinigi,</hi> as to <hi>Caſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="279" facs="tcp:12126:148"/> a man of rare note, not only for thoſe times he lived in, but for many ages that had paſt long before. He was of a ſtature higher than ordinary, and his limbs were well anſwerable each to other, and of ſuch a grace hee was in his aſpect, and entertain'd all men with that humanity, that hee never ſpake with any, that he ſent from him diſcontent; his haire inclin'd to a reddiſh colour, and he wore it always cut above his eares; and always and in all ſeaſons, whether it rain'd or ſnew, he went with his head uncover'd; hee was very pleaſing to his friends, and terrible to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; juſt among his ſubjects, treacherous with forreiners: nor where hee could vanquiſh by fraud did he ever ſtrive to do it by force: for he ſaid the victory, and not the manner how it was got, gain'd a man glory; no man enter'd more boldly into dangers, nor was more wary to get out of them: and he was wont to ſay,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:12126:149"/> that men ought to prove every thing, but to be aſtoniſh'd at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and that God favours va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant men, who alwayes chaſtiſes the feeble with the mighty. Hee was alſo very admirable in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying or biting ſharply or gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilely; and as in this kind hee ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not any, ſo likewiſe he was nothing mov'd, when himſelfe was not ſpar'd: So that we have many things he ſaid wittily, and heard patiently, as theſe: Having cauſd a duck at to bee given for a ſtarling, and a friend of his repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him for it, ſaid <hi>Castruccio,</hi> thou wouldſt not have given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a peny for it; and his friend ſaying it was true, he reply'd, a duck at is leſſe to mee. Having a flatterer about him, and in ſcorne having ſpat upon him, the flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer ſaid, that Fiſhermen to take a little Fiſh ſuffer themſelves to be all moyl'd in the Sea; I will let my ſelfe be daub'd by a little ſpettle, to catch a Whale: which <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> not only heard patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:12126:149"/> but rewarded. When one told him, that he livd too ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly; ſaid <hi>Caſtruccio,</hi> if this were a vice, there would not bee ſo ſplendide entertainments at the Saints Feaſts. Paſſing through a ſtreet, and ſeeing a young man comming out of a whore-houſe all bluſhing, becauſe he had been ſeen by him; he ſaid to him, be not aſham'd when thou goeſt out, but when thou enterſt in. A friend of his giving him a knot to looſe, that was curiouſly tyed, ſaid, O foole, doſt thou think I will looſen ſuch a thing, which being tyed gives me ſo much trouble? <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> ſaying to one that profeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a Philoſopher, you are of the condition of dogs, that always go about thoſe who can beſt give them meat; no ſays the party, we are like Phyſitians, who viſit their houſes that have moſt need of them. Going from <hi>Piſa</hi> to <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorne</hi> by water, and a dangerous ſtorme there ariſing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon being much perplex'd, was
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:12126:150"/> reprehended by one of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as puſillanimous, ſaying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was not afraid of any thing; to whom <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> reply'd, that he nothing marvayl'd thereat, for every one valu'd his life, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its worth. Being ask'd by one, what he ſhould do to gaine a good eſteeme? anſwered him; ſee when thou goeſt to a Feaſt, that a blocke ſit not upon a blocke. When one boaſted that hee had read many things; ſaid <hi>Castruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio,</hi> it were better thou couldſt brag thou hadſt remembred much. Another bragging though he had tippled much, he was not drunk; reply'd, an Oxe does the ſame. <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> kept a young laſſe, which he lay with ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and thereupon being reprov'd by a friend, telling him, that it was a great wrong to him that he had ſuffer'd himſelfe to bee ſo taken by a Wench; thou art mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, quoth <hi>Castruccio,</hi> I took her, not ſhe me. Alſo when one blam'd him that he was too de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:12126:150"/> in his dyet; hee ſaid to him, I warrant thou wouldſt not ſpend herein ſo much as I doe; that is true quoth the other; then reply'd he, thou art more cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, than I am gluttonous. Being invited to ſupper by <hi>Tadeo Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardi</hi> a <hi>Luccheſe,</hi> a rich and magnificent citizen; and in the houſe <hi>Tadeo</hi> ſhewing him a chamber all furniſh'd with cloth of gold, and that it was all pav'd with curious ſtones, which were diverſly wrought with ſundry colours, and repreſented flowers, leaves, and ſuch like green things: <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> having got together a great deale of ſpettle in his mouth, ſpat it full in <hi>Tadeos</hi> face; at which he ſhewing himſelfe much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, ſays <hi>Caſtruccio,</hi> I knew not where to ſpet that I might offend thee leſſe. Being ask'd how <hi>Caeſar</hi> dy'd? ſaith he, would to God I might dye like him. Being one night in a houſe of one of his Gentlemen, where there were divers Ladyes invited to a feaſt,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:12126:151"/> and hee dancing, and ſporting with them, more than befitted his condition, was reprovd by a friend, anſwered, he that is held a wiſe man in the day time, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be thought a foole in the night. One comming to aske a favour at his hands, and <hi>Caſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio</hi> ſeeming as if he heard not, fell down upon his knees before him, whereat <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> chiding him, he anſwered, thou art the cauſe thereof, who carryeſt thine eares in thy feet: and thereby he gaind double the favour he asked. He uſed to ſay, that the way to Hell was eaſie, becauſe men went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther downwards, and blindfold. When one askd him a favour with many and ſuperfluous words, <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> ſaid to him, hereafter when thou wouldſt any thing with me, ſend another. Such another man having wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him with a tedious ſpeech, and telling him in the latter end, perhaps I may have tir'd you with my long ſpeaking; no, thou
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:12126:151"/> haſt not, ſaid he, for I heard not one word of all that thou haſt ſpoken. He was wont to ſay of one, who had been a handſome boy, and afterwards became a comely man, that he was too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious, having firſt diſtracted the husbands from their wives, and afterwards the wives from their husbands. To an envious man that laughd, he ſaid, laughſt thou becauſe thou art well, or becauſe another ſuffers evill? When he was alſo under the rule of Maſter <hi>Francis Guinigi,</hi> one of his play-fellows, ſaying to him, what wilt thou that I ſhall give thee, for a blow on the mouth? <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> anſwered him, a Helmet. Having cauſd a citizen of <hi>Lucca</hi> to dye, who had helpd him in his riſing to his greatneſſe, when it was ſaid to him, he had ill done to put to death one of his old friends; he reply'd, you are deceivd, I have put to death a new enemy. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruccio</hi> commended much thoſe that betrothd wives, but never
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:12126:152"/> married them, like men that ſay they will go to Sea, but never do. He ſaid he wondred much at men, that when they bought any veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of earth or glaſſe, they ſound it firſt whether it be good; but in taking a wife they are content only to ſee her. When hee was neare death, one asking him, how he would be buried? he anſwered, with my face downwards: for I know, that as ſoon as I am dead, this Country ſhall go upſide down. Being asked, whether he never thought to become a Fryer to ſave his Soule? he ſaid no, for it was ſtrange to him, that <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> ſhould go to Paradiſe, and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>guccion</hi> of <hi>Faggivola</hi> to Hell. Being asked, when it was beſt to eate, to preſerve the health? he anſwered, if a man be rich, when hee is hungry; if hee be poore, when he may. Seeing a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man a friend of his, that made his ſervant truſſe his points, hee ſaid, I hope one day too thou wilt make him feed thee. Seeing

The City of <hi>Sinigallia</hi> from the foot of theſe Mountaines is not much further than a bow-ſhot, and from the Sea not above a mile di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant: along the ſide hereof runs a little river, which waſheth that part of the wals, which is towards <hi>Fano,</hi> looking towards the high way, ſo that till it come neare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Sinigallia,</hi> it runs for a good part of the way along the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines: and being come neare up to the river that paſſes alongſt by <hi>Sinigallia,</hi> it turnes upon the left hand alongſt the banke thereof: So that running on for the ſpace of a-bow-ſhot, it reaches to a
